            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This being thought on and conſidered by me, and thereunto adioyned a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and due conſideration of mine owne inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to profit the Church of God (as I am bound and as I deſire) by ſpeaking, and eſpecially that part of Gods Church to which I ſtand in ſpeciall relation as an vnworthy Ouer-ſeer, and to which my good will is to deale not onely the Gospell of God,
<note place="margin">1.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this ſeuenth Chapter the Apoſtle bends his force againſt an aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and foule imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">The generall purpoſe and drift of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this Chapter.</note> that ſome either wicked, or weake, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, or might caſt vpon him (namely) this; That hee ſhould vilifie and abaſe the Law of GOD, too much and more then was meete.</p>
            <p>In that he ſaid <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.20. that the Law did increaſe ſinne: That the Law entring, ſinne abounded, vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:422:5"/>of that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, ſome haply thought, and it may be ſome did not ſticke to vtter it, that the Apoſtle did wrong the Law, and did too much abaſe it: and therefore in this Chapter he cleeres himſelfe, from doing any wrong at all to the Law, and ſhewes how his ſpeech may be vnderſtood, and how it may receiue a right and good conſtruction, and not be in any ſort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to the Law.
<note place="margin">The generall matter of this Chapter.</note> And in this Chapter, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall argument and matter of it: the Apoſtle ſhewes how true Beleeuers are freed and deliuered from the Law, and vpon occaſion of that, he meets with ſome cauils and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies that might be brought againſt the Law: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it, and ſhewing the true vſe of it, and withall ſets forth in his owne example, the combat and fight that is betweene the Fleſh and the Spirit, in ſuch as are truely regenerate. In theſe things ſtands the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this ſeuenth Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now the parts of it are theſe three.
<note place="margin">The parts of this Chapter.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is a declaration how true Beleeuers are freed from the Law, from the beginning of the Chapter to the ſeuenth Verſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is a cleering of the Law, from ſome foule blots that haply ſome might ſeeke to blemiſh it withall, and a commendation of the Law, with a manifeſtation of the true vſe of it, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. to the 14.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is a troubled complaint of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: that though he were regenerate, and had receiued a great meaſure of grace and ſanctification, yet through the reliques of ſinne ſtill abiding in him, he was far from the ſpirituality (as I may ſay) of the Law, and that hee was euen carnall in reſpect of the ſpirituall nature of the Law: and ſo ſetting forth in his owne particular an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the combat betweene the Fleſh and the Spirit in them that are truely regenerate, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now then to come to the firſt part of the Chapter:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:422:5"/>The firſt part of it ſhewing how true Beleeuers are freed from the Law; we muſt know that it hath reſpect to that which the Apoſtle had ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That true Beleeuers are not vnder the Law, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grace. For from that Verſe to the beginning of this Chapter, the Apoſtle hath beene buſied in refuting a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Obiection that ſome might bring againſt that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his, and hauing remoued that Obiection,
<note place="margin">The ſumme of the firſt part.</note> hee returnes to that he there propounded, &amp; doth here proue that true Beleeuers are freed from the Law: ſhewing how they are freed from it.</p>
            <p>His argument to that purpoſe is, from the ſtate and condition of true Beleeuers, namely, this:</p>
            <p>That true Beleeuers are dead to the Law, and thus the Apoſtle reaſons; Dead men are not held vnder the Law, they are freed and they are deliuered from it. But ſuch are you, and ſuch are wee, as many as truely beleeue in Chriſt are dead to the Law: and therefore we are freed and deliuered from it.</p>
            <p>The firſt Propoſition of this Argument is in the firſt Verſe, not in expreſſe termes, but eaſie to be gathered from thence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſition is in Verſe 4. and theſe two Propoſitions being conceaued, the Concluſion muſt needs follow vpon them.</p>
            <p>Now both the firſt and ſecond Propoſition of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<note place="margin">The amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by a ſimilitude, wherein are three propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> are further ſet forth by a ſimilitude taken from the Law of Matrimony, wherein there be three propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> like as a woman is free from her husband when he is dead, and is not any longer bound to that man, by the Law of Marriage, Verſe 2. and</p>
            <p>Secondly, as her husband being dead, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſhee may take another husband, and ſo doing is no Adultereſſe, Verſ. 3.</p>
            <p>And the third, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is implyed, that as ſuch a woman may bring forth children by another husband.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:422:6"/>
            <p>Then followeth the reddition and correſpondent parts anſwerable to theſe three, Verſe 4. that ſo true Beleeuers are, firſt, dead to the Law; and, ſecondly, that they are married to Chriſt; and, thirdly, that they may bring forth fruit to him.</p>
            <p>And that third correſpondency is further amplified in the 5. and 6. Verſes, by a compariſon <hi>à paribus.</hi> That as when true Beleeuers were vnder the Law, and as it were married to the Law, they brought forth fruit to death: So now, being freed from the Law, &amp; married to Chriſt, they ſhould bring forth fruit to God.</p>
            <p>And ſo we briefly ſee the generall ſcope of the Apoſtle in the firſt ſixe Verſes of this Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>Know yee not, Brethren, (for I ſpeake to them that know the Law) that the Law hath dominion ouer a man as long as he liueth?</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this firſt Verſe,
<note place="margin">The generall matter of the firſt Verſe.</note> as you ſee, the Apoſtle affirmes thus much: That a man is vnder the Law, and the Law hath power and dominion ouer a man, ſo long as he liues, and no longer: thereby implying, that when a man is dead, he is freed from the Law, and ſo the generall Propoſition is thereby implyed, That dead men are freed from the Law.</p>
               <p>Now touching the truth of this, that the Law hath dominion ouer a man ſo long as he liueth, the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales to the Romanes themſelues, and to their owne knowledge: affirming that they knew it to be a truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering his minde to them by way of interrogation, which is more emphaticall: and affirming the thing more ſtrongly, and vſing a kinde and louing terme, a compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:422:6"/>of loue and good affection towards them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the like good affection from them to him againe <hi>(Brethren.)</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Know yee not, Brethren?</q>
               <p>ANd then before he deliuer the thing it ſelfe, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts a proofe of it: that the thing he affirmes was well knowne to them, namely this, that they were not ignorant of the Law, but had knowledge of it, and were well acquainted with it: For, ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeake to them that know the Law, that the Law hath dominion ouer a man ſo long as he liueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then,
<note place="margin">The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this Verſe.</note> in this Verſe wee haue theſe particulars laid before vs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the thing the Apoſtle affirmes, namely this, that while a man liues, the Law hath dominion ouer him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is not only affirmed as a truth, but as a knowne truth, euen a truth knowne to them to whom he writ, whom he ſtiles by the name (Brethren,) <hi>Know yee not, Brethren?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thirdly, we haue the proofe of that, that the thing affirmed was knowne to them, becauſe they were well acquainted with the Law, in theſe words: <hi>(For I ſpeake to them that know the Law.)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpretation</note>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs now a little examine the words of this Verſe, touching the ſenſe and meaning of them; <hi>Know yee not, Brethren?</hi> This interrogation or queſtion is as much as an earneſt affirmation, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely you know it, I make no queſtion of it, but you doe know it, and it is a thing well knowne to you. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> firſt, beloued in the Lord, whom I affect in the Lord, and reſpect, as thoſe that are conioyned with me, by one band of one Truth, one Faith, one hope of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the band of the ſame Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt, for <hi>I ſpeake to them that know the Law,</hi> that is, I ſpeake to them that are well acquainted with the Law.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:422:7"/>
               <p>No doubt, the Apoſtle meant chiefly the Chriſtian Iewes that were among the Romanes, the Iewes conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the faith of Chriſt. And by the Law we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Morall Law</hi> of God, as appeares plainely by that inſtance the Apoſtle giues afterward, Verſe 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not lust.</hi> That the Law hath dominion, &amp;c. for the right vnderſtanding of theſe words wee muſt know, that the morall Law of God in the force and ſtrength of it, and as it is in it ſelfe conſidered, is an hard Lord or Maſter, it requires exact, and perfect, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall obedience to it, and it binds ouer to the curſe for the leaſt breach of it, and through the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it ſtirs vp to ſinne, as the Apoſtle ſhewes afterward in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Law hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer a man;</hi> his meaning is, that the Law hath power ouer a man, as an hard Lord or Maſter, to require of him exact, perfect, and perpetuall obedience to it, and to accuſe, and to condemne him, and to binde him ouer to the curſe for the leaſt breach of it: and through the corruption of his owne nature to ſtir him vp to ſinne (as long as he liueth.) The word <hi>(liueth)</hi> is not here to be taken at large, as if the meaning were, as long as a man liues in this world, but with relation to the Law, as it is ſaid Verſe 4. <hi>Dead to the Law,</hi> ſo here (as I take it) the Apoſtle meanes, liueth to the Law (that is) ſo long as a man is a liuing man to the Law, ſo long as a man liues vnder the Law, and is not freed from it by Chriſt. Thus then briefly conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My beloued in the Lord, whom I affect in the Lord, and reſpect as thoſe that profeſſe the ſame Truth, the ſame Faith, and hope of Saluation with me, and are knit to me by the bond of the ſame Spirit of Chriſt: you certaynely know this to be a truth that I affirme, it is a thing well knowne to you; for I am ſure, I ſpeake to ſuch as are well acquainted with the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:422:7"/>Law, euen with the morall Law of God: that the morall Law of God hath power ouer a man to require of him exact, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and perpetuall obedience, and to accuſe, and to condemne him, and to binde him ouer to the curſe for the leaſt breach of it: and through the corruption of his owne heart, to ſtir him vp to ſinne ſo long as he is a liuing man to the Law, and liues vnder the Law, and is not freed from the power of it by Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to ſuch things as are hence offered for our inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Firſt, obſerue wee that the Apoſtle deliuering this Poſition,</p>
               <p>That the Law hath dominion ouer a man as long as he liueth, he doth not barely affirme it, but he deliuers it as a knowne truth, as a truth certainely knowne to them, to whom hee writ. And hee ſaith to them, Know yee not? which is as much as if he had ſaid, Certainely you doe know it to be a truth, it is a thing well knowne to you, that the Law hath dominion ouer a man ſo long as hee liueth.</p>
               <p>Now, the Apoſtle ſetting downe this as a thing known to them, to whom he writ, they being ſuch as had liued vnder the Law in former times, he giues vs to vnderſtand thus much:</p>
               <p>That we are to be well acquainted with the Doctrine we liue vnder, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>1</label>
                  <note place="margin">Men are to be familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that doctrine of the Word of God, that is taught amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them.</note> that doctrine of the Word of God that is taught amongſt vs, and deliuered to vs, muſt not bee ſtrange to vs, but it ought to be familiar and wel knowne to vs, and we are to be well acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>As the Apoſtle ſaid here to them, who not long before liued vnder the Law, You know the extent, the reach and power of the Law, that the Law hath dominion ouer a man ſo long as he liueth; ſo it muſt be with vs now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnder the Goſpell: We muſt be ſo well acquainted with the doctrine of the Goſpell, euen with the extent and reach of the Goſpell, and with all points of ſauing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:422:8"/>knowledge, expreſſed and made knowne in the doctrine of the Goſpell, as that the Miniſters of the Goſpell in teaching and preaching, may be able to ſay to vs and that truly, You know this, or you know that point of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge, and this or that point of ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a thing well knowne to you.</p>
               <p>And for this, we haue not only euidence and ground in this Text, but in other places of Scripture. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15. ſaith the Apoſtle, I ſpeake as to them which haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, iudge yee what I ſay: as if he had ſaid, That which I deliuer to you concerning the Sacrament, (for of that hee ſpeakes in the next Verſe) I ſpeake it, as to thoſe that are well acquainted with the doctrine of the Sacrament, euen with that high and heauenly myſterie of the Goſpell; and I refer my ſelfe euen to your owne iudgement, I doubt not, but you are able to iudge and diſcerne of the truth I deliuer to you; you are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. And indeed this is the thing that was promiſed and foretold, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.34. that in the time of the new Teſtament, men ſhould not teach one another, ſaying, Know the Lord, but there ſhould be ſuch a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull meaſure of knowledge in them, that ſhould liue vnder the Goſpell, as that all ſhould know it, euery one ſhould be acquainted with the doctrine of the Goſpell. And to this purpoſe are thoſe exhortations,
<note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20.</note> That wee ſhould not be children in vnderſtanding;
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9.</note> That wee ſhould not be carryed about with diuers ſtrange doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. And to this end the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. That Chriſt aſcending vp on high, led captiuitie captiue, and gaue gifts vnto men. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Euangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers: then <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. That we henceforth be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carryed about with euery winde of doctrine by the ſleight of men, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning craftineſſe, whereby they lye in wait to deceiue, that we ſhould be of a riper age in the knowledge of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:422:8"/>of the Goſpell: that we ſhould be well acquainted with the doctrine of the Goſpell, and with the myſteries of Saluation.</p>
               <p>And therefore certainely this is a dutie incumbent, <label type="milestone">

                  </label>
                  <note place="margin">Reproofe of ſuch as are now ignorant of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and grounds of the Goſpell.</note> and lying on euery one of vs, now in the time of the Goſpell, the doctrine of the Goſpell taught amongſt vs muſt not be ſtrange to vs, but it ought to be familiar and well knowne to vs, we are to be well acquainted with it: but alas, I muſt needs here breake out into a complaint, it is farre otherwiſe with too many amongſt vs: How many haue we that are ignorant of the very firſt principles and grounds of the Goſpell! they know not God as hee hath reuealed himſelfe in the face of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Some are ſo groſly ignorant, as they know not what Chriſt is, they are not able diſtinctly to ſpeake of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt, of his Office, and of his worke of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, theſe are ſtrange things to ſome, as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heſea</hi> 8.12.</p>
               <p>They know not how they may be made partakers of the benefits of Chriſt; what Faith is, what Repentance is, what belongs to Mortification and to Sanctification, nor how they may be ſaued by Chriſt: which indeed is groſſe and palpable ignorance, and a fault that cannot be ſufficiently taxed now in theſe dayes and times, wherein the Goſpell ſhines moſt cleerely, and eſpecially where there hath beene, and now be meanes of inſtruction; that men ſhould be ſo groſly ignorant, it is a monſtrous ſhame, yea it is a ſinne that one day (without repentance) ſhall preſſe men downe to the bottomeleſſe pit of hell: and ſhall much increaſe their condemnation and torment in hell.</p>
               <p>For certainely, where the meanes of ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge haue beene greater, and not a profiting by them in a meaſure anſwerable to the greatneſſe of them; there iudgement ſhall be greater, and condemnation deeper; and know it for a truth, it is the Word of God vttered
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:422:9"/>by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. Thou that now liueſt vnder the Goſpell, ſhalt one day come to be iudged by the Goſpell, and if thou be found ignorant of things reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Goſpell, and that thou haſt not profited by the doctrine of the Goſpell, which hath beene preached in thy nearing, euen the Goſpell and Doctrine of ſauing comfort that thou haſt heard, ſhall be a bill of indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt thee, and ſhall condemne thee: For thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of the doctrine of ſaluation, which thou oughteſt to know, and mighteſt haue knowne if thou hadſt beene carefull to learne it, how canſt thou looke to be ſaued? yea, conſider yet further what the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <q>If the Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them that be loſt: if now in the cleere ſhining light of the Goſpell thou ſee not that light, but be blinde and ignorant of the myſteries of ſaluation, thou hast cauſe to feare that it brands thee out for a reprobate, that thou art as it were marked out for a caſt-away, and one that without ſpeedy amendment ſhall be damned in hell: ignorance of the doctrine of the Goſpell in ſuch as ought to know it, and might haue knowne it, is a fearefull ſinne, it ſhewes not only want of grace, and want of ſanctification, but that God euen now ſits in iudgement vpon ſuch perſons, and hath begun to make knowne to them their reprobation and finall perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he will certainely execute vpon them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they ſpeedily repent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Oh, let theſe things be duly conſidered, and let them ſtirre vp euery one that is ignorant, neuer to reſt till hee come to a meaſure of ſound knowledge of the doctrine of the Goſpell, that alone will yeeld him comfort in life and in death: yea when he commeth to ſtand before the iudgement Scate of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the name and title of loue, the kind and louing compellation here vſed by the Apoſtle, is to be obſerued, the word <hi>(Brethren.)</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:422:9"/>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſtiles them, to whom he writ, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>
                  </label> by the name <hi>Brethren:</hi> thereby ſignifying (as I ſhewed you) his owne kind and louing affection towards them, that he did ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and dearely affect them in the Lord, and reſpect them, as thoſe that were conioyned with him, by the bond of one Truth, one Faith, and one hope of Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Thereby alſo implying the like louing affection in them towards him againe: the point hence is this:</p>
               <p>There ought to be a ſpeciall and mutuall loue and good affection, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>2</label>
                  <note place="margin">A ſpeciall and mutuall loue and good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red betweene the Teachers of the Word and Gods People.</note> betweene the Teachers of the Word and Gods People: the Teachers of the Word are to loue and affect Gods People, with a brotherlike affections, and to tender their good, and to ſhew it forth that they doe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, by all good meanes to the vttermoſt of their power: and the people of God are to take notice of that loue where it is, and to acknowledge it, and to anſwere it with like loue and good affection againe. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. ſaith the Apoſtle, O Corinthians, our mouth is open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: our heart is made large. And then <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. hee requires the like loue of them againe. Now (ſaith hee) for the ſame recompence, euen in liew of my loue againe, Be yee alſo enlarged. And the Apoſtle in many places te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies his loue to the Church and People of God: as, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.8. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. to the end of the Chapter; and hee requires like loue againe from Gods People to their Teachers as appeares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. where he intreats the helpe of their prayers as a teſtimonie of their loue. And, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. ſaith the Apoſtle, We beſeech you, Brethren, that yee know them, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among you, and are ouer you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. That yee haue them in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular loue for their works ſake. Not to enlarge the point; the reaſon of this, that there ought to be a ſpeciall and mutuall loue betweene the Teachers of the Word and Gods People, is this:</p>
               <p>It is a loue to Gods People, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> that makes the Teachers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:422:10"/> of the Word carefull, and conſcionable, and faithfull, in the diſcharge of their dutie: and it is loue againe from Gods People to their Teachers that makes them profit by them, when they know and acknowledge the Word of their Teachers: whether they be the words of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of comfort, or reproofe, or the like, not to be words of courſe, but of conſcience, and to proceed out of a loue and tender care ouer them for their good. Oh, it makes them to eſteeme highly of them, and to take profit by them. And therefore for the vſe of this.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that men profit not by the teaching of the Word, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label>
                  <note place="margin">Whence it is that men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit not by the teaching of the Word, as they ought and might.</note> as they ought, and might doe; becauſe indeed they acknowledge not the loue of their Teachers, and their tender care ouer them for their good: and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they iuſtly taxe and reproue them for their ſins, then they quarrell with the affection of their Teacher, and then they thinke he ſpeaks out of ſpleene or malice, and then they thinke he loues them not, and ſo they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their owne profiting by his teaching.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt therefore take notice of this dutie, and as wee ſee and diſcerne a loue and good affection in our Teachers towards vs, and that they haue a tender care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs for our good, and doe ſhew it forth in inſtructing, in comforting, in admoniſhing, and in reprouing vs iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our ſinnes: ſo we are to take notice of that loue and tender care, and to anſwere it againe with like loue and good affection; yea, euen when they doe iuſtly reproue vs for our ſinnes, and ſhew vs the iudgements of God due vnto vs for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And let ſuch as will not now acknowledge the loue and care of ſuch as labour with them, to doe them good, by reprouing them for their ſinnes, and ſeeke to draw them out of their ſinnes to amendment of life, know, that the Lord by his ouer-ruling hand will ſo bring it to paſſe, that in their extremities they ſhall be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and then they ſhall iuſtifie the loue of ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:422:10"/> as did formerly reproue them, yea haply then they ſhall wiſh for their prayers, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did for the prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> when the hand of God was on him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.8. and as the ſtubborne Iſraelites did, the prayers of <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom not long before they neglected, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19. Yea, wicked <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in caſe of extremitie ſends to the Prophet, whoſe doctrine he would not follow, and no worſe a meſſenger then his owne Wife, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 14. And we may obſerue it, that many (who at other times) regard not what the Miniſters of the Word ſay to them, in tender care ouer them for their good, yet in time of extremitie are forced by the powerfull hand of God, to ſend and to ſeeke to them for comfort, and haply then, by the iuſt iudgement of God can find no comfort from them, but are left in their miſerie.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore now take notice of the loue and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of our Teachers ouer vs for our good, &amp; learne to anſwere it with like loue and good affection againe: and let vs haue them in ſingular loue for their works ſake.</p>
               <p>The next thing here to be obſerued, is the proofe the Apoſtle brings, that they to whom he writ, knew the thing affirmed by him to be a truth, in theſe words, For I ſpeake to them that know the Law.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle makes this a proofe, that they knew the thing he affirmed to be true, That the Law hath domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer a man as long as he liueth. <label type="milestone">

Such as are thorowly informed in the doctrine of the Law, or of any other part of the Word of God, and are well acquainted with it, they know the particular vſe of the Law, or of that part of the Word, wherewith they are ſo acquainted, if men knew the will of God reuealed in his Word, as they ought to know it, either comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dutie, promiſing mercy, or threatning iudgement, they know not only the ſubſtance and truth, but they know alſo the particular vſe of that commandement, of that promiſe, and of that threatning denounced in the Word of God; there is not onely a knowledge of the truth and ſubſtance of it, but a knowledge alſo of the particular vſe of it. And hence it is that the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. that the Romanes ſhould be changed by the renewing of their minde, that they might proue what is the good will of God, and acceptable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. His meaning was that they ſhould labour not only to be inlightned and to haue knowledge of the good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God, but that they ſhould labour alſo that they might acknowledge it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and embrace it, in the right and holy vſe of it, and in the vſe of it pleaſing to God. We find that the Apoſtle thus prayed for the Coloſſians, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9. that they might be fulfilled with knowledge of the will of God, and then he ſubjoynes and addes further, in all wiſdome and ſpirituall vnderſtanding, as if he had ſaid: I pray for you, not only that you may be fulfilled with knowledge, and haue a great meaſure of knowledge of the will of God, and may know it in the truth and ſubſtance of it, but that yee may alſo rightly and wiſely know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, that you may wiſely conceiue the truth of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:422:11"/> Word of God, and may wiſely diſcerne the right and true vſe of it in euery particular. Theſe places, not to adde any more, doe ſufficiently cleere and proue that if men know the will of God reuealed in his Word as they ought, in the commandements, in the threatnings, and in the promiſes of it: they know the particular vſe of thoſe commandements, of thoſe threatnings, and of thoſe promiſes. And where there is ſound knowledge of any part of the Word of God, there is knowledge both of the truth and ſubſtance, and of the particular vſe of it. And the reaſon of it is this:</p>

And ſuch as are not iuſtified by Chriſt, and adopted to be Gods children, they are ſtill vnder the Law. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe and in the Verſes following (as before I haue ſhewed) the Apoſtle doth amplifie his Argument, by which he proues that true Beleeuers are freed from the Law, by a ſimilitude taken from the Law of Marriage, the ſeuerall proportions of it I haue laid forth heretofore, I will not now ſtand to remember them. As this ſecond Verſe hath reſpect to the Verſe foregoing, it contaynes an illuſtration of that Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>That the Law hath dominion ouer a man as long as he liueth;</hi> from the example of a married woman; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hauing ſaid, that the Law hath dominion ouer a man ſo long as he liueth. In this Verſe he doth illuſtrate and ſet that forth by the example of a woman that is married to an husband, namely thus, as it is with a wife,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:422:14"/> as a wife is vnder the power of the Law of Marriage, and by the Law of Marriage is bound to her husband, during the life of her husband, euen ſo long as her husband liues: ſo it is with a man that is vnder the Law, he is as it were married to the moral Law of God, he is vnder the power of the Law ſo long as he liues.</p>
               <p>Now whereas this example may ſeeme not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Apoſtles Propoſition, his Propoſition being this, That a man is vnder the dominion of the Law ſo long as he liueth, and this example runneth thus, That a wife is vnder the Law of Marriage not ſo long as ſhee liueth, but ſo long as her husband liues, that ſcruple is eaſily anſwered, if wee conſider the drift and purpoſe of the Apoſtle, which is this, to ſhew that death ſets a man free from the Law of God, (in what ſenſe we ſhall ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward) as death ſets a wife free from the Law of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that is the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, whether it be by the death of the wife or by the death of the husband it skils not, that purpoſe is ſtill held and kept.</p>
               <p>Now in this Verſe conſidered by it ſelfe, wee haue more particularly two things offered to our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that a wife is bound to her husband ſo long as he liues, and this the Apoſtle propounds with a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by her condition, as ſhee is a wife, that ſhee is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in ſubiection to a man: and withall hee ſhewes how ſhee is bound to her husband, as that ſhe is vnder a Law, and bound to him by a Law. The woman (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) which is in ſubiection to a man, is bound by the Law to the man while he liueth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is this, that a wife is freed from her husband when her husband is dead. And that the Apoſtle ſets downe in the proofe of it, thus: That her husband being dead, ſhee is ſet free from that Law that binds her to her husband, and therefore then ſhe is freed from him. But (ſaith the Apoſtle) if the man be dead, ſhee is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:422:15"/> from the Law of the Man: and ſo we ſee the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matter and ſubſtance of this Verſe.</p>
               <q>For the Woman which is in ſubiection to a Man.</q>
               <p>THeſe words are a deſcription of a wife,
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, for the married woman the wife, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks cleerely. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39. The wife is bound to her husband (is bound by the Law to the man) the word <hi>(Law)</hi> is not here vſed in a large ſenſe, for the morall Law of God (though indeed for a branch of it) but more ſtrictly for the ſpeciall and particular Law of Marriage, euen for that perpetuall Law made by God himſelfe concerning Marriage, whereof we reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. by which the husband and wife are bound one to another moſt neerely and moſt ſtrictly, ſo as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. The wife hath not the power of her owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the husband: and the husband hath not the power of his owne body, but the wife; and neither may the husband giue his body to another woman, nor the wife giue her body to another man. That is the ſpeciall Law of Marriage, by which God hath bound the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band &amp; wife each to other moſt neerly and moſt ſtrictly. So then the Apoſtles meaning is this: <hi>The woman that is married to a man, is bound by the ſpeciall and perpetuall Law of Marriage to that man alone (while he liueth)</hi> that is, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his naturall life, ſo long as that man is aliue, but if the man be dead, theſe words are plaine; if <hi>that man be dead,</hi> that is, if his naturall life be taken away and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by any meanes whatſoeuer, ſhee is deliuered, ſhee is ſet free from the Law of Marriage, from that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Law of Marriage ſtrictly binding her to that man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſhee is then ſet free from that man, and the Law of Marriage doth not any longer binde her to him. Thus then wee may briefly take vp the ſenſe of the words of this Verſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the woman that is married to a man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Meaning.</note> 
                  <hi>the wife is bound
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:422:15"/> by the ſpeciall Law of Marriage, euen by that perpetuall Law made by God himſelfe concerning Marriage, to that man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to whom ſhee is married, to her husband, and may not giue her ſelfe to any other man during the naturall life of that man, but if that mans life be taken away and determined, then ſhee is ſet free from that particular Law of Marriage, and the Law of Marriage doth not any longer binde her to that man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt, the mayne and principall thing intended by the Apoſtle in this Verſe, comes to be conſidered, and that is the illuſtration of his former Propoſition, by the example of a married woman: That as a married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a wife is vnder the ſpeciall Law of Marriage, and by that Law is bound to her husband during the life of her husband: So is euery one that is vnder the Law, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the Law. Hence then we ſee the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as are vnder the Law, further ſet forth to vs, and the point hence is this:</p>

<note place="margin">He that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, is as ſtrictly bound to the rigour and curſe of the Law, as a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried woman is bound to her husband, during his life.</note> as a married woman is vnder the power of the ſpeciall Law of Marriage: a man that is vnder the Law, is as ſtrictly bound to the Law, to the rigour and to the curſe of it, as a married woman is bound to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band during the life of her husband, and he can no more exempt himſelfe from the power of the Law, nor winde himſelfe from vnder the power of it, then a wife can iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exempt her ſelfe from the lawful power and authority of her husband, and as a wife is to keepe her ſelfe only to her husband, ſo is he that is vnder the Law to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe only to the Law, &amp; as yet he is to haue no meddling with the Goſpell: and hence is the Law called by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, a yoke of bondage. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. Be not intangled againe with the yoke of bondage, as if he had ſaid, with that which is as a yoke and binds you moſt ſtrictly to it ſelfe. And, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.14. the Apoſtle cals it an hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, an Obligation, a Bond. And putting out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:422:16"/> writing of Ordinances that was againſt vs, which was contrary to vs: in which compariſon is notably ſet out, how ſtrictly men that are vnder the Law are bound to the rigour of the Law, and to the curſe of it, the Law is as a Bond, and they are as it were parties named within the Bond, and they are moſt firmely and ſtrongly bound to the condition of that Bond, that is, to the rigour and curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>The reaſon and ground of this truth, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>

                  </label> that ſhe is a woman in ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a man, meaning, the married woman, the Wife; the point hence is this:</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>2</label>
                  <note place="margin">The condition of a Wife, is ſubiection to her Husband.</note> a Wife ought to be a Woman ſubiect to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that is the thing that chiefly concernes her, and on this runnes the whole Scripture in euery place where the dutie of the Wife is expreſſed or vrged, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. Thy deſire ſhall bee ſubiect to thy Husband, and hee ſhall rule ouer thee. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. Let your women keepe ſilence in the Churches; for it is not permitted vnto them to ſpeake: but they are commanded to bee vnder obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as alſo ſayth the Law. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.22.

Wiues, ſubmit your ſelues vnto your owne Husbands, as it is fit in the Lord, and ſo in many other places. To handle this point at large, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much time. Only take we notice in generall, that this ſubiection the Wife is to yeeld to her Husband, ſtands chiefly in two things.</p>
               <p>In Reuerence both inward and outward,
<note place="margin">Wherin the ſubiection of the Wife to her Husband ſtandeth.</note> and in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The Wife is to thinke reuerently of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and to carry in her heart a reuerent awe and feare towards her Husband, and to ſhew it forth by reuerent ſpeeches and geſtures, and ſhe is to yeeld obedience vnto him in all things honeſt and lawfull, and agreeable to the will of God. Thus did <hi>Sara,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Sara</hi> obeyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and called him Lord.</p>
               <p>Now if Wiues duly examine themſelues touching theſe things,
<note place="margin">Reproofe of ſuch Wiues as yeeld not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to their Husbands.</note> many will bee found exceeding defectiue, and farre ſhort of that duty they owe to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, yea, many will bee found ſuch as <hi>Michal</hi> was, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.16. euen ſuch as deſpiſe their Husbands in their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:422:17"/> hearts, yea, ſome ſhew it forth in their ſpeeches and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures by ſcoffing and mocking, by tuſhing and puffing at their Husbands, yea, ſome ſticke not to breake out into groſſe and bitter termes againſt their Husbands, yea (which is moſt fearefull) ſometimes to curſe and to ban their Husbands, whom they ought to reuerence and feare. And as for obedience, Oh, how farre ſhort are many Wiues, in that ſome ſticke not to vtter it in plaine termes, that they will not doe this or that the Husband inioynes them, though it be a thing honeſt and lawfull, if he would neuer ſo faine! for Example, they will not leaue off this or that apparell, haply too fine for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or too gariſh for the faſhion; let the Husband ſay or doe what he will or can, they will weare it.</p>
               <p>Thus and many other wayes are Wiues wanting in their ſubiection vnto their Husbands, and they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded to it, becauſe they are ſo neerely knit to their Husbands, euen one fleſh with them, and they are their yoke-fellowes, and therefore they think it is vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and that too much is laid on them, that they are inioyned to yeeld ſubiection to their Husbands.</p>
               <p>Now then, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to perſwade with ſuch as make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their dutie; let Wiues conſider theſe things:
<note place="margin">Arguments to perſwade Wiues to yeeld ſubiection to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> Firſt, if they refuſe to yeeld ſubiection vnto their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, they peruert the order of Nature, it is all one, as if the body ſhould refuſe to be guided by the Head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they violate the Ordinance of God, for God hath ordained, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Wife ſhould be ſubiect to her Husband.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> they make themſelues odious in the ſight of God, and of all, that truly feare God. And</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they blot and blemiſh all other their good qualities: admit the Wife is chaſte, wiſe, diſcreet, frugall, an excellent Huſwife and ſuch like, yet if ſhee bee not ſubiect to her Husband, all theſe things are nothing worth, ſhe brings a blot on them all, yea, vpon her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:422:18"/> if ſhe ſeeme religious, by denying ſubiection to her Husband, ſhee makes the name and word of God to be ill ſpoken of, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. and ſhee hath but a ſhew and ſhaddow of Religion, ſhee denyes the power of it, ſhee hath no truth nor ſoundneſſe of Religion in her, her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will yeeld her no comfort.</p>
               <p>Oh then thinke on theſe things, thou wife, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou art, and be ſtir'd vp to yeeld ſubiection to thy husband, and lay aſide all reaſonings of the fleſh, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thou to ſubdue all thy rebellious thoughts, that riſe vp in thine heart to the contrary, and neuer reſt till thou ſhew thy ſelfe reuerent toward thine husband, and obedient to him in all things, honeſt, lawfull, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of God.</p>
               <p>The next thing offered to our conſideration, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>
                  </label> is the firſt thing here affirmed by the Apoſtle, namely this, That a wife is bound by the ſpeciall and perpetuall Law of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to her husband, as long as he liues; and the point hence is the very Propoſition of the Apoſtle,</p>
               <p>That the wife is bound to her husband, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> during the life of her husband,
<note place="margin">The husband and wife are bound each to other, ſo long as they liue in this world.</note> euen ſo long as her husband liues; and it is true alſo of the husband, that he is likewiſe bound to his wife, during the life of his wife, and ſo long as his wife liues.</p>
               <p>The Law of Marriage binds the husband and the wife each to other, ſo long as they liue together in this world: and with this agrees that of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39. he there deliuers the ſelfeſame Propoſition, that the wife is bound by the Law as long as her husband liueth: but if her husband be dead, ſhee is at libertie to marry with whom ſhee will, onely in the Lord. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. we reade, that the Phariſes comming to Chriſt, tempting him and demanding, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. whether it were lawfull for a man to put away his wife for euery fault, Chriſt brings them backe to the firſt inſtitution of Marriage, and ſaith to them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. Haue yee not read, that He which made
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:422:18"/> them at the beginning, made them Male and Female. <hi>Verſ</hi> 5. and ſaid, For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue Father and Mother, and cleaue to his wife, and they twaine ſhall be one fleſh. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. They reply and ſay to him, Why then did <hi>Moſes</hi> command to giue a Bill of diuorcement, and to put her away? Chriſt anſwers againe, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. That <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe of the harndeſſe of your heart, ſuffered you to put away your wiues, but (ſaith he) from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not ſo. Where we ſee that Chriſt ſhewes that God hath ſo neerely conioyned Man and Wife to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as that they are no more twaine but one fleſh: and though <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the hardneſſe of their hearts, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to giue a Bill of diuorcement; yet it was not ſo either by the firſt inſtitution of Marriage, or in the practice of the firſt Age of the World: it was not ſo with <hi>Adam,</hi> with <hi>Seth,</hi> with <hi>Noah,</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and with <hi>Iaacob,</hi> they put not away their wiues for euery fault, but hauing taken wiues, they kept them till death, as God had ordayned, euen according to the firſt inſtitution of Marriage. And from the words of Chriſt we may take the reaſon and ground of this truth:</p>
               <p>That the husband and wife are bound each to other, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> ſo long as they liue in this world together, and it is this: They are coupled together by God himſelfe, comming together as they ought, and they are ſo neerely knit one to another, as that they are no more twaine but one fleſh, the vnion that is made by Marriage, being ſo neere, and ſo ſtrict, and being made by God himſelfe, it muſt needs be a truth, that the husband is bound to the wife ſo long as ſhee liues, and the wife is bound to her husband ſo long as he liues, and when man and woman ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in marriage and become husband and wife, they are bound one to another during the time they liue together in this world. Now then, the vſe of this concernes both Parents that haue children to diſpoſe in marriage, and alſo ſuch as be vnmarried and purpoſe to enter into that ſtate of life.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:422:19"/>
               <p>Parents are to be wiſe and warie in diſpoſing their children in marriage. <label type="milestone">

Now, thus ſtands the caſe in that waighty buſineſſe of marriage: a man that marries a wife, is bound to his wife, ſo long as ſhee liueth: and a woman that giues her ſelfe in marriage to a man, is bound to that man ſo long as hee liueth: though there proue to be difference and diſagreement in their ſeuerall diſpoſitions and natures, and one of them proues a great and heauy croſſe to the other, yet being married, they are bound one to the other, not for a day, a weeke, a yeere, or for a certayne limited time, but for terme of life, euen ſo long as they liue together in this world, and therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe great care, and great aduice, and deliberation ought to be vſed, both by Parents in diſpoſing their children in marriage, and by perſons vnmarried in making their choice.</p>
               <p>Parents are to endeuour ſo to diſpoſe their children in that ſtate of life, and vnmarried perſons are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſo to make their choice, as they may looke for the bleſſing of God on their match, and both the husband may find comfort in his wife, and the wife may find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in her husband, and to that end ſpeciall care muſt be had,

               <p>Now if the Papiſts anſwere to this queſtion,
<note place="margin">The Popiſh anſwere.</note> they will tell you, that indeed nothing but death ſets a wife free from her husband, or a husband free from his wife: Though (ſay they) for fornication one may depart from anothers company, the husband may depart from his wife, and the wife may depart from her husband, yet nothing but death diſſolues the bond betwixt man and wife: theſe be their very words, and this is their note on this place.</p>
               <p>Now this is falſe and erroneous, that nothing but death diſſolues the knot of Marriage knit: for wee are taught by the Word of God, that in two other caſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides death, the Marriage bond is diſſolued: as, firſt,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He generall matter of this Verſe is briefly this: That a wife is at libertie when her husband is dead, and may then lawfully marry with another man: but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly we haue here offered to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</p>
               <p>Firſt, a conſequent, which the Apoſtle inferres on that which hee had before deliuered: for hauing ſaid in the Verſe before, that the wife is bound to her husband, while her husband liueth: here hee inferres on it, That if therefore the wife take another man, while her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band liues, ſhee is an Adultereſſe, yea, he ſaith, ſhee ſhall be ſo called.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:422:21"/>
               <p>And then he deliuers by way of oppoſition to this, the Propoſition chiefly intended by him in this Verſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this: That the husband being dead, the wiſe is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and may lawfully marry with another man, and that in ſo doing ſhee is no Adultereſſe. And this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſets downe in the proofe of it: thus,</p>
               <p>That the husband being dead, the wife is freed from the Law that binds her to her husband, and therefore then ſhee is freed from him, and though then ſhee take another man, ſhee is no Adultereſſe. But (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) if the man be dead, ſhee is free from the Law, ſo that ſhee is not an Adultereſſe, though ſhee take another man. And ſo wee ſee the generall matter of this Verſe. The wordes need not long to bee ſtood on touching the ſenſe of them: I will briefly cleere them.</p>
               <p>So then, or ſo therefore, If while the man liueth,
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> ſhee take another man, that is, if while the husband is aliue, ſhee ioyne her ſelfe to another man, and marry another man, ſhee ſhall be called an Adultereſſe, the word <hi>(called)</hi> here ſignifieth thus much, ſhee ſhall be held an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe, and that by the voice and conſent of all men, all men that know her ſhall ſo repute her, ſo ſpeake of her, and ſo call her: we haue the ſame word, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26.</note> It is there ſaid, that the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians in Antiochia, that is, they were ſo named, not by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of man, but by diuine Oracle, and that by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:422:22"/> ioyne her ſelfe in marriage to another man. So then the meaning of the words of this Verſe is, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So then, or ſo therefore, if while the husband is aliue in this world, the wife ioyne her ſelfe to another, and marry another man, ſhee is a Wedlocke-breaker, and a tranſgreſſor of the Law of God, and that by the voice and conſent of all that know her, all that know her ſhall ſo ſpeake of her, and ſo call her, and may iuſtly call her an Adultereſſe: but if her husbands naturall life be taken away, ſhee is free from that ſpeciall and perpetuall Law of Marriage, binding her to her husband, ſo that then ſhee is no Wedlock-breaker, nor Adultereſſe, though ſhee ioyne her ſelfe in marriage to another man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that the Apoſtle hauing before ſaid, that the wife is bound by the Law to the man while he liueth; doth here inferre on that:</p>

                  </label> The Apoſtle ſaith, The wife that takes another man while her husband liueth, ſhal be called an adultereſſe.

               <p>Againe, Adulterie defiles the body, in more ſpeciall manner then other ſinnes: whence it is that men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are counted diſhoneſt, if not onely, yet chiefly for the ſinne of fornication and adulterie.

                  </label> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſaid that a wife is freed by the death of her husband from the Law of Marriage, here he ſaith, That ſo it is with the true beleeuing Romanes, and other true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers amongſt them, that they in like manner are freed by death from the Law, euen from the rigour and curſe of the Law.

Further proofe of this we huue, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. The Apoſtle ſaith there, That Chriſt hath redeemed Gods choſen, as

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5.</note> and, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. he ſaith, That Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubiect to the Law, that hee might redeeme them that were vnder the Law, that is, vnder the bondage and curſe of it, that he might ſet them free from that bondage and curſe of the Law: and therefore certainely, true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers are as free from the rigour and curſe of the Law, as a wiſe is free from her husband, when her husband is dead, and they are no more vnder the rigour and curſe of the Law, then a wife is vnder the power of her husband, when her husband is dead: and the reaſon of this is,</p>

Now that we find not in any place of Scripture, that true beleeuers are freed from the Goſpell, and therefore that is but a fancy of the Papiſts, that the Law and Goſpell are all one for ſubſtance.

               <p>Againe, this being ſo, that true beleeuers are as free from the curſe of the Law, as a wife is from her husband when he is dead; it may teach as many as truely beleeue in Chriſt, not to feare any euill ouer-much, as reuilings and curſings of ill tongues, witch-craft, plague, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, famine, ſword, or death it ſelfe: for why? the curſe which makes all theſe things hurtfull, is remoued from them that are in Chriſt: and therefore let not them feare theſe things before they come, nor be diſcouraged when they fall on them: What though thou be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a common calamitie, as by dearth, by peſtilence, by ſword, or the like? yet remember this, if thou be in Chriſt, the venom and ſting of thoſe things is remoued from thee, and they fall not on thee as a curſe, and let that be thy comfort and cheere vp thine heart.</p>

               <p>Now we come to haue part in the death of Chriſt, by <hi>faith</hi> in his death; by <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> wee come to be partakers of the merit of his death, for the taking away of the guilt of ſinnes, and the puniſhment due to vs for our ſinnes: and that wee deceiue not our ſelues in this point; for herein euery one will be readie to flatter and ſoothe vp himſelfe, and to thinke he hath <hi>faith</hi> in the bloud of Chriſt, for the waſhing away of his ſinnes, and thereupon preſume to come to the Sacrament of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of Chriſt, wherein <hi>faith</hi> is ſpecially dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the death and paſſion of Chriſt; that wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deceiue not our ſelues: Let vs know this for a truth, that we can neuer haue true faith in the bloud of Chriſt, vnleſſe wee be further inlightened, then by the light of nature, or then nature can afford, and be made to ſee the ſinnes of our hearts and liues, yea to ſee our particular ſinnes: the vileſt wretch that liues, can in generall ſay he is a ſinner; but our ſight of ſinne muſt be more ſpeciall, we muſt ſee our particular ſinnes, and wee muſt ſee them together with the curſe and iudgements of God atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on them, that we may be humbled for them, and find our ſelues ſtand in need of the bloud of Chriſt, for the pardon of them; Many mens hearts and conſciences can tell them of their particular ſinnes, and yet they are not humbled for them; and what is the cauſe?

               <p>One thing yet remaynes to be gathered from theſe words of the Apoſtle: In that he ſaith, True beleeuers are dead to the Law, that is, freed not only from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and curſe of the Law, but alſo from the power of the Law, euen that power it hath to ſtirre them vp to ſin through their owne corruption, and that by the <hi>body,</hi> that is, by the death of Chriſt.

               <p>Theſe and many other places that might be brought, doe make this a cleere point, that Chriſt is not onely the husband of the Church, but he is ſuch an husband as liues for euer, hee being rayſed from the dead, hee is no more ſubiect to death, but now liues an immortall life, and ſhal certainely continue the husband of the Church, and of all true beleeuers for euer; the reaſon and ground of this truth is this:</p>

                  <hi>Chriſt being rayſed from the dead,</hi>

                  </label> hee liues no more a naturall &amp; fraile life, a life ſuſtayned by naturall meanes; Chriſt in his Reſurrection put away his natural and fraile life, or at leaſt, the qualitie and condition of it, and changed it into an heauenly and ſpirituall life, into a life without infirmities, and not ſuſtayned by foode, and the like, as before, and ſo into a life immortall, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can decay: and therefore on this ground wee may certainly conclude, that Chriſt being the husband of the Church, he is an euer-liuing husband, and ſhall vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly continue the husband of the Church, and of all true beleeuers for euer.</p>
               <p>This, in the firſt place may ſerue to diſcouer to vs, that, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that is an error and a falſe opinion,

               <p>But indeed they peruert the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and they miſconſter his meaning; for the Apoſtles pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in that place is not (no, not ſo much as by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to ſignifie, that any true beleeuer may be wholy ſeparated &amp; diuorced from Chriſt, but his purpoſe there is to ſet out the haynouſneſſe, and vglineſſe of the ſinne of Adulterie and Fornication, and that it were a moſt foule, vnſeemely, vile, and monſtrous thing, that any that make profeſſion of the truth of Chriſt, and hold themſelues to be members of Chriſt, ſhould ſo forget themſelues and their owne excellent condition, as to proſtitute and abaſe their bodies, that are members of Chriſt, and ioyne them with an Harlot, and make them one body with an Harlot; that were a moſt vile thing.</p>
               <p>And that that is the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, appeares plainely by his wordes, <hi>Know yee not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that

               <p>Is it ſo, that Chriſt being the husband of the Church, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Comfort for true beleeuers in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt troubles and diſtreſſes.</note> and continues the husband of the Church and of all true beleeuers for euer? Then here is a ground of ſweet and of excellent comfort, for all that truly beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt; hereupon they may cheere vp their hearts, and they may comfort themſelues in their greateſt troubles and diſtreſſes: for what though their troubles be great, and lye heauy vpon them? yet there is no trouble, no affliction, no diſtreſſe whatſoeuer that can make a ſeparation and a diuorce betweene them and Chriſt their head and husband, hee ſtill continues their head, and hee is ſtill their husband, euen when they are plunged into their deepeſt diſtreſſe: and that may be a great comfort to them.</p>
               <p>We know it is a comfort to a wiſe in the time of ſome great loſſe, that her husband is yet liuing, though her goods be taken away and loſt by fire, by water, or the like; though ſhee haue loſt her children, and her deareſt and her neereſt friends are taken away from her, yet this is a ſtay to her fainting heart, and this cheeres her vp, that her kind and louing husband is yet aliue, and ſhee hath him ſtill with her; for ſhee is ſure that he will beare part with her, in her diſtreſſe and trouble, and that he will be a guide and comfort, and an helpe to her in any thing for her good, ſo farre as hee is able. This ſhee is ſure of, and this comforts her. Oh much more may true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers comfort themſelues &amp; cheere vp their hearts in their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:422:38"/> greateſt troubles, croſſes and loſſes whatſoeuer they be, I ſay, much more may they comfort themſelues with this; that their head and husband Chriſt Ieſus is yet aliue; for he is an husband all-ſufficient, able to ſuccour helpe and comfort them, and they may be ſure that he will releeue and comfort them, yea, that he will euen beare part with them in their troubles: They may aſſure themſelues of this, there is not any affliction they ſuffer, but Ieſus Chriſt their head and husband beares part with them, and hee ſuffers with them.</p>
               <p>Oh then, thinke on this in thy greateſt affliction, thou that art a true beleeuer; what though it be ſo, that thou haſt loſt thy goods, thy outward libertie, thy wife, thy children, thy deareſt friends, yea, thou being a wife, haſt loſt a kind, a louing, and deare husband? Yet remember this to thy comfort, there is no loſſe, no affliction, that can turne away Gods loue from thee, and make a diuorce betweene thee and Chriſt Ieſus thine head and husband: No, no, he is an euer-liuing husband, he is ſtill thine huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſhall ſo continue for euer. Yea, remember yet further to thy comfort, thou that art a true beleeuer, though thy affliction be ſo great, as that thy very life is taken away from thee, yet there is no diuorce made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and Chriſt Ieſus: Death may ſeparate thy body and ſoule aſunder, but it cannot diuide thee from thy God, and make a diuorce betweene thee and Chriſt Ieſus thine head and husband: No, no, hee is ſtill thine, and thou art ſtill his.

               <p>Secondly, ſuch things both in heart and life, as are as ſweet fruits to God, euen ſuch thoughts, affections, words &amp; works, as are pleaſing to God through Chriſt, and ſuch as hee of his mercy will crowne with no leſſe then the reward of eternall life and glorie, as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.

               <p>Thus then wee are to conceiue the Apoſtles meaning in theſe words:</p>

               <p>And laſt of all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> how farre forth thoſe motions had power and working, namely, to the bringing forth of fruit, and what manner of fruit it was, as that it was deadly, that it was fruit to death. <hi>The motions of ſinnes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which were by the Law, had force in our members to bring forth fruit vnto death.</hi> So we ſee the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things that are laid downe in this fift Verſe: I will not now enter on the other part of the Apoſtles compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon laid downe Verſe 6. till wee come to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it.</p>

               <p>And againe, if euill thoughts, thoughts of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, be conuaid into the mind of man or woman, onely from the Deuill, aſſuredly they are not their ſinnes, but the Deuils ſinnes, and hee ſhall anſwere for them; they are their croſſes, not their ſinnes, and they ſhall neuer be laid to their charge, vnleſſe they entertayne them, and giue conſent to them.

               <p>We may obſerue, that the Apoſtle ſometimes exhorts, that the corruptions and euill motions that are ſtirring in the heart, ſhould be ſuppreſſed, and kept from brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out by the parts and members of the body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29.

               <p>The firſt part of this compariſon is laid downe <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. which we haue alreadie handled; In this ſixth Verſe the Apoſtle comes to the other part of it, namely this, That himſelfe and other true beleeuers, being now deliuered from the Law, they ought, and they were bound in lieu of that mercy, to bring forth fruit to Chriſt, and to ſerue
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:422:59"/> the Lord; that is the generall matter of this ſixth Verſe.</p>
               <p>The particulars of it are theſe: Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Apoſtle makes knowne, that himſelfe and other true beleeuers were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the Law, ſetting that in oppoſition to their former condition, in theſe words: <hi>But now we are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Law.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Wee were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fleſh, and conſequently vnder the Law; but now we are in a contrary ſtate and condition, now we are deliuered from the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſets downe the proofe of that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that they were deliuered from the Law, and that is from the death of that which held them in bondage vnder the Law, in the next wordes: <hi>That being dead, wherein wee were holden.</hi>

               <p>And then in the next place hee layes downe the end of their deliuerance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that himſelfe and other true beleeuers were deliuered from the Law, to this end, that they ſhould ſerue the Lord, expreſſing alſo wherein, namely, in newneſſe of Spirit.

               <p>
                  <hi>(Being dead vnto it)</hi> that is, being broken, and as it were, dead, and not able to bring forth curſed and bitter fruits as it was wont. <hi>(Wherein we were holden)</hi> the word rendred <hi>(holden)</hi> properly ſignifieth forcibly and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically holden.

               <p>Now our thankefull acknowledgement and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the mercy and power of God in our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is expreſſed in walking worthy of that mercy in ſome meaſure of holy obedience; and therefore this muſt needs be held as a certaine truth, that our freedome from any yoke of bondage, is a ſtrong bond ſtrictly binding vs to ſerue the Lord, and to walke before him in all holy obedience.</p>

               <p>In the next place we are to obſerue, how the Apoſtle here proues that himſelfe and other true beleeuers were deliuered from the law. Thus he proues it, that the force, the power and the ſtrong working of the corruption of nature, was broken, and as it were, dead in them, and not able to bring forth the curſed fruit of it, as it was wont, and therefore they were deliuered; ſo reaſons the Apoſtle. Hence wee are giuen to vnderſtand thus much, That the power and force of ſinne being weakened and broken in vs, and as it were, dead, and not able to bring forth the curſed fruits of it, as in former times it was wont, it is an Argument, and a plaine euidence &amp; proofe of this, That wee are freed from the Law, euen from the rigour and curſe of the Law. <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">The power and force of ſinne being weakened in men, it proues that they are freed from the rigour and curſe of the Law.</note> and that now the corruption of his nature hath not that ſtrong, powerfull, and violent working in him as it hath had in times paſt, and that the euill motions of it haue not force in his members to bring forth fruit vnto death, he may certainely conclude, that hee is freed from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Law, and from the curſe of it: and for this,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:422:63"/> we haue further euidence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 1. ſaith the Apoſtle,

                  <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> And then he ſubioynes, <hi>Which walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit:</hi> thereby noting who they be that are and may aſſure themſelues that they are freed from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. As if he had ſaid, In whom the grace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſo powerfull, as to ſubdue the corruption of their nature, and to bring it vnder; ſo as now the force of it is weakened, and broken, and now they walke not after the luſts of the fleſh, but after the Spirit. Certainely they are in Chriſt, and they may conclude, that they being freed from the curſe of the Law, and from condemnation, they are not vnder either the rigour or curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes plainely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. <hi>If yee be led by the Spirit, yee are not vnder the Law:</hi> If the power and ſtrong working of ſinne be broken in you, and that yee are now guided and led by the Spirit of grace, yee are not vnder the Law, yee are freed from the rigour of the Law, and from the curſe of it. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Knowing this,</hi> or, <hi>We know this, It is a thing well knowne to vs, that the Law is not giuen,</hi> or the Law lyeth not againſt a iuſt man, againſt a man that is iuſt and holy, both by righteouſneſſe imputed and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in him, and is ſanctified by grace, and ſo hath the force and power of ſinne broken in him, the Law lyes not againſt ſuch a man, hee is freed from it, in reſpect of the rigour and curſe of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe places (not to adde any more) doe ſufficiently cleere and confirme this truth: That if a man finde the force of ſinne broken in himſelfe, and that now the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his nature hath not that ſtrong and violent working in him as it hath had in former times, hee may certainely conclude, that hee is freed from the rigour of the Law, and from the curſe of it; and the reaſon and ground of it is this:</p>

               <p>We are further to marke, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That being dead wherein we were holden.</hi> He ſaith not, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead that was in vs, the force, the power, and ſtrong working of ſinne being dead that was in vs; but that wherein wee were held, that is, which did ſtrongly, and forcibly, and as a Tyrant, hold vs in bondage vnder the Law.

For this we haue further euidence and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Scripture.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26.27</note> 
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26, 27. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Hee would giue his people a new heart and a new Spirit: hee would put his Spirit within them, and take away the ſtony heart out of their body, and giue them a heart of fleſh, and cauſe them to walke in his Statutes, and keep this Iudgements, and doe them.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Hauing giuen you a new heart, and hauing renued you by my Spirit, you ſhall then yeeld to mee new obedience, and ſpirituall ſeruice, both in heart and life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. The Apoſtle thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the true beleeuing Romanes, <hi>I beſeech you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by the ſweet mercies of God, that you giue vp your bodies a liuing ſacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is your reaſonable and ſpirituall ſeruing of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence it is that true beleeuers are often called on in Scripture, and exhorted to a new courſe of life, and to yeeld to the Lord new thoughts, new words, and new actions, as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, let him be a new creature.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. the Apoſtle thus exhorts the Epheſians, That they ſhould <hi>caſt off, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conuerſation in times paſt, the old man, which is corrupt through the deceiuable luſts,</hi> Verſ. 23. <hi>And be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Spirit of your mind,</hi> Verſ. 24. <hi>And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> And to this purpoſe I might cite many more teſtimonies, all driuing to this iſſue, and vrging this dutie on true beleeuers, that they are to yeeld to the Lord, new obedience and ſpirituall ſeruice, both in heart and life: and the reaſon of this is giuen by Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and he muſt haue worſhip</hi> and ſeruice, ſutable and agreeable to his nature, true worſhippers, and ſuch as truly ſerue God, muſt worſhip and ſerue <hi>him

               <p>And therefore this muſt needs be held to be a dutie of all true beleeuers, euen of as many as would ſerue the Lord as they ought, that they are to yeeld to him new obedience, and ſpirituall ſeruice both in heart and life.</p>
               <p>Before I come to make vſe of this, I hold it needfull to ſtand a little further on it, that wee may better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, and that it may be more profitable to vs: I will therefore,</p>

               <p>For the firſt.
<note n="1" place="margin">The ground of true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſeruice of God.</note> The ground of true ſpirituall ſeruice of God, is a true knowledge of God, as hee hath reuealed himſelfe in his Word, to know God to be infinite in power, wiſdome, iuſtice, mercy, holineſſe, goodneſſe, &amp;c. and that he is a Beholder and a Iudge of all ſecrets, and will render to euery man according to his works. This is the very roote and ground of all ſound, heartie, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection in the ſeruice of God. We reade, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Daniel</hi> thus prayed, <hi>O Lord God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which art great and fearefull, and keepeſt couenant and mercy toward them which loue thee, and toward them which keepe thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we may obſerue, that <hi>Daniel</hi> firſt rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues the greatneſſe and goodneſſe of God, and from thence proceeds an heartie and humble confeſſion of his ſinnes, and the ſinnes of the people: and indeed, God cannot be ſerued in Spirit and Truth, of them of whom hee is not knowne in ſome meaſure by the light of his Word. It is not poſſible that a man ſhould either truſt or hope in God, or loue him, or feare, or ſerue him as he ought, when he knowes him not. <q>It is his mercy, loue, <label type="milestone">

                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:422:68"/> goodneſſe, truth, power, iuſtice, and ſuch like, that cauſeth men to truſt, hope, loue, feare and ſerue God as they ought:</q> therefore to know God truly, as he is ſet forth in his Word, is the ground of the true, ſound, and ſpirituall ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>Now what true ſpirituall ſeruice of God is,
<note n="2" place="margin">What the true ſpirituall ſeruice of God is.</note> thus wee are to conceiue it. It is a true acknowledgement of Gods power, iuſtice, mercy and goodneſſe, with an inward and ſincere affection in ſome proportion agreeable to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement: for as wee know by the light of the Word, that God is iuſt, good, and omnipotent: ſo muſt wee in his ſeruice, in our hearts acknowledge him ſo to be, and be affected towards him accordingly in all duties of Gods ſeruice: with the outward worke, muſt goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and good affections, and then wee ſerue God with ſpirituall ſeruice; and this is that the Lord in all times hath called for: Thorowout the Booke of God wee are taught, to ſerue God in pureneſſe of Spirit, in ſimplicitie and ſoundneſſe of heart; and that is ſpirituall ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>Now in the third place,
<note n="3" place="margin">The kinds of the ſeruice of God.</note> for the kinds of this ſeruice: they are two; either it is ſuch as is immediately perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to God, as in all actions of religious worſhip, in hearing, in ſpeaking the Word of God, in Prayer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Sacraments, and the like. Or ſuch as is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately offered vp to God, as in the duties of loue, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, equitie, and iuſtice to men; for therein alſo we ſerue God. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.24. the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Seruants in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeruice to their Maſters in ſingleneſſe of heart, they ſerue the Lord Christ.</hi> Thus then conceiue we the doctrine.</p>
               <p>True beleeuers are to yeeld to the Lord new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſpirituall ſeruice, both in heart and life, that is, they are to know and acknowledge God as hee is made knowne in his Word, euen a God of infinite power, goodneſſe, mercy, truth and iuſtice, and to ſerue him in truth of heart and inward affection anſwerable to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:422:68"/> that acknowledgement, both in euery action of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip, and in euery dutie of loue, mercy, equitie, and iuſtice, they performe to their Brethren.</p>
               <p>This being a truth, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> it ouerturnes that Popiſh doctrine of <hi>Opus operatum.</hi> The Papiſts teach,

I leaue it, and for vſe of the point, to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that true Beleeuers are to yeeld to the Lord, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Will you ſay that they are not religious, and that they are not Gods ſeruants, becauſe they are not ſo preciſe as haply you are? They will needes be held religious and Gods ſeruants, and yet many of them are ſuch deuout and religious perſons,

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:422:73"/> and this groſſe concluſion the Apoſtle diſclaymes: hee meets with it in this Verſe, on this manner.

And then ſecondly, he puts downe that concluſion, that they in likelyhood might, or, it may be, did inferre by way of interrogation likewiſe, <hi>Is the Law ſinne?</hi> Shall wee thus conclude, doth this Concluſion follow on my former Poſition, that therefore the Law is ſinne? To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers negatiuely, and generally no, and that in a phraſe of deteſtation, as abhorring ſuch a foule Concluſion: <hi>God forbid.</hi> And then to this generall anſwere hee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes a further refutation of that abſurd Concluſion, by an Argument from a right and proper vſe of the Law: that the Law is ſo farre from being the cauſe of ſin, that one right vſe of it is, to diſcouer ſinne and to make it knowne, inſiſting in his owne example. <hi>Is the Law ſinne?

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:422:73"/> Poſition, that the Law is the cauſe of ſinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God forbid:</hi> that is a phraſe of abhorring and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Farre be it from vs ſo to thinke; fie on it, it is a very abſurd and groſſe thing ſo to thinke; nay, or nay rather, I knew not ſinne, but by the Law. That phraſe <hi>(I knew not ſinne)</hi> implyes two things: Firſt, this; I was ignorant of ſome things to be ſinnes, which yet are ſinnes, I knew them not, or I tooke no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them to be ſinnes. And ſecondly, this; I was ignorant of the greatneſſe of ſinne; ſuch things as I knew to be euill by the light of nature, I did not ſoundly and thorowly know to be ſo euill as indeed they are, but by the Law, that is, by any other meanes but onely by the Law. The word <hi>(Law)</hi> here ſignifieth the morall Law of God, publiſhed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ten Commandements, as appeares by the inſtance following; <hi>For I had not knowne luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt:</hi> that is, I had neuer come to know luſt to be ſinne, but that looking into the Law of God, I found it there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden and condemned, the Lord in the ten Commandements ſaying directly, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet,</hi> or, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lust.</hi> And by Luſt in this place, wee are to vnderſtand both the rebellion of nature, the inclination to euill, and thoſe firſt motions whereby wee are ſtirred vp to euill, and doe with delight thinke any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the loue of God or our Neighbour, though wee neuer giue conſent of will to commit that euill: for the Apoſtle hauing but the vſe of reaſon, could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Concupiſcence with conſent of Will was ſinne, which the Heathen by the light of Nature did know and confeſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus then briefly conceiue we the meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the words of this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What then? what followes on that Poſition, that the motions of ſinnes which were by the Law, had force in our members to bring forth fruit vnto death? What ſhall we thereupon inferre?
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:422:74"/> Doth this concluſion follow on it, That the Law is the cauſe of ſinne? Oh, no: farre be it from vs ſo to thinke; it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd and groſſe ſo to imagine, nay rather, this is a truth: I ſpeake but of mine owne experience, I my ſelfe was ignorant of ſome things to be ſinnes, which yet were ſinnes, and the things I knew to bee euill by the light of Nature, I did not ſoundly know to be ſo euill, as indeed they are, by any other meanes but onely by the morall Law of God. For example, I had neuer come to know that Luſt, the rebellion, the inclination to euill, and thoſe motions whereby wee are ſtirred vp to euill, and doe with delight thinke of any thing contrary to the loue of God or our neighbour, though we yeeld not conſent of will to commit that euill, were ſinnes, but that looking into the Law of God, I found them there expreſſely forbidden, the Lord in the tenth Commandement ſaying directly, Thou ſhalt not couet, or, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi>

Surely they might as well, in this reſpect, reproach the Truth taught by the Apoſtle, and by the Lord himſelfe. Is it not the Truth of God, becauſe ſome doe force from it abſurd and groſſe concluſions? Nay rather, we are to acknowledge it to bee the ſame Truth that was taught by the Apoſtle, ſeeing the Diuell ſeekes to peruert it, as hee did in olde time: the Diuell is ſtill like himſelfe, and he labours now as much as euer, nay, more, becauſe hee is neerer to his end, to corrupt men, to ſow errors, and to force from the holy Truth of God many abſurd and groſſe concluſions. And the conſideration of this may ſtrengthen vs againſt offence, in regard of many damnable errors and hereſies that ſprout vp together with the preaching of the ſound and holy Truth of God.</p>

               <p>Againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when a man is able to ſpeake out of his owne experience, and to deliuer Inſtruction, Admonition, Counſell or Comfort, as a thing whereof himſelfe hath had experience, it is a ſpeciall meanes to confirme that which is deliuered, and to worke it into the mindes, and to ſeate and ſettle it on the hearts of the hearers: and therefore (doubtleſſe) he is the beſt Teacher, that is able to deliuer the holy Truth of God for Inſtruction or Comfort, out of his owne experience.

               <p>The holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> a man truely ſanctified, could not beleeue his Lord and Maſter, the Lord Ieſus, who knew his heart, and could not deceiue him; yet (I ſay) he could not beleeue him, when hee foretold him of his threefold denyall, he could not be perſwaded there was ſo much wickedneſſe in his heart. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.35.

               <p>And hence it is that ignorant perſons pleaſe themſelues in a conceit, that they loue God with all their hearts, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:422:81"/> they loue their Neighbour as themſelues: and is it not the ſpeech of many that if they had liued in the dayes of Chriſt, they would haue beene farre from dealing with him as the Iewes did? and if they had liued in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> they would haue beene farre from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their hands in the bloud of the holy Martyrs: nay, they would rather haue taken part with them againſt <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardener,</hi> and the reſt? Will not many tell you thus, who notwithſtanding ſhew themſelues moſt ſpitefull and malicious againſt them that profeſſe the ſame truth the holy Martyrs did, and in whom appeares the like pietie and zeale?</p>
               <p>And will not they tell you thus, that traduce them that truly feare God, and rayle on them, and reuile them, and giue them all manner of opprobrious names, and hold them baſe and vile?

And therefore let none of vs deceiue our ſelues; let vs not thinke it an eaſie matter to find our the lurking ſinnes and corruptions of our owne hearts.

               <p>The next thing that comes to be conſidered, is this, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I had not knowne luſt to be ſinne, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> He was deceiued touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luſt, and he had not knowne it to be ſinne, but that looking into the Law of God, he there found it expreſly to be forbidden and condemned, and ſo came to ſee his error and to be conuinced of it.

                  <hi>The Word of God,</hi> as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>is liuely and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in operation, and ſharper then any two-edged ſword, and entreth thorow, euen to the diuiding aſunder of the Soule and the Spirit, and of the ioynts and the marrow;</hi> and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a Diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, that diſcernes the thoughts and the ſinfulneſſe of them.

And therefore, as God alone is the Searcher of the heart, ſo that VVord that declareth to man what be his thoughts, that his very euill thoughts to which he giues no conſent of will, are ſinnes, muſt needs bee the VVord of the ſame God, euen the eternall VVord of the eternall and euerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God.

Poore ſoules! they deceiue themſelues exceedingly: if they did but looke into their owne hearts by the light of the Word of God, and by the Law of God, they would be farre from thus exalting nature, that would diſcouer to them that the naturall ſtreame of <hi>their heart is onely euill, and that continually, Gen.</hi> 6.5. and that the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which they are ſtirred vp to euill, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will follow not, are ſinnes; and the conſideration of that would pull downe their pride and high conceit of their pure naturals.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe Verſes read, the Apoſtle goes on further, to cleere the Law from thoſe foule blots that ſome might haply ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh it withall; as to be the cauſe of ſinne and of death: and he ſhewes, that not the Law, but ſinne taking occaſion by the Law, wrought Concupiſcence, reuiued in him, deceiued him and ſlue him: that is the ſumme of theſe foure Verſes. To come to the handling of them as they lye in order.</p>
               <p>In the 8. Verſe wee haue two things offered to our conſideration. Firſt, a conceſſion or grant made by the Apoſtle, that ſinne is an accidentall euent of the Law; and this hee propounds with a reference to that which went before, implyed in the firſt word <hi>(But.) But ſinne tooke an occaſion by the Law.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, The Law indeed is ſo farre from being the cauſe of ſinne, as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers ſinne, and makes ſinne knowne: but yet this I muſt needs grant and yeeld vnto, that ſinne is an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall euent of the Law, ſinne happens, or ſinne comes to paſſe vpon occaſion of the Law.</p>
               <p>Now this Propoſition is not thus barely propounded; but the Apoſtle, in propounding of it, ſhewes whence it is that ſinne is an accidentall euent of the Law, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the prauitie and corruption of nature, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:422:87"/> tooke occaſion by the Commandement to be ſtirring and to be working. And inſiſting in his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, hee makes knowne, how farre the corruption of nature was ſtirring &amp; working on occaſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in himſelfe, euen to the bringing forth of all manner of concupiſcence. Saith he, <hi>Sinne tooke,</hi> or, <hi>ſinne taking an occaſion by the Commandement, and wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words the Apoſtle puts downe another vſe of the Law, in reſpect of ſuch as be vnregenerate: That in reſpect of them, it hath this vſe as an accidentall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it ſtirres vp the corruption of their natures, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of the Commandement forbidding luſt, the luſt of their hearts becomes more violent, and ſtirres in them more ſtrongly, and breakes out more violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all manner of ſinnes; and then to this Propoſition the Apoſtle ſubioynes a reaſon, which is, from the abſence of the Law, or from the ignorance of it, that where ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Law is abſent, or not knowne, there ſinne lyes dead, in the laſt words, <hi>For without the Law, ſinne is dead.</hi> And that is further confirmed and amplified in the words following. But to keepe within the compaſſe of this eighth Verſe, we ſee the parts of it:</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Propoſition, wherein is particular inſtance of the Apoſtles owne example, in theſe words, <hi>Sinne tooke,</hi> or, <hi>ſinne taking an occaſion by the Commandement, &amp; wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> And then a reaſon of that in the words following: <hi>For without the Law, ſin is dead.</hi>

                  <hi>But ſinne.]</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpretation</note> The word <hi>Sinne</hi> in this place ſignifieth the prauitie or corruption of nature, that in-bred corruption that we brought with vs into the world, and carry about vs continually: it is the ſame with that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall body, that yee ſhould obey it in the lusts thereof. Tooke,</hi> or, <hi>Taking occaſion.</hi> The word here rendred <hi>Occaſion,</hi> ſometimes ſignifieth opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing a thing, it cannot be ſo taken in this place,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:422:87"/> but the meaning is this: That though the Law giue no occaſion of ſinne, yet mans nature is ſo corrupt, as it is ſtirred vp by the Law forbidding ſinne, and thereby it takes occaſion to be working, and more fiercely breakes out into all manner of ſinnes. <hi>(By the Commandement.)</hi> By that Commandement that forbids Luſt ſpoken of in the Verſe before, by that Commandement truly known, and duely conſidered. <hi>(Wrought in me)</hi> that is, effected and brought forth in me, I being yet in my naturall ſtate and condition, being yet in the fleſh, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>When we were in the fleſh. (All manner of concupiſcence.)</hi> The word <hi>(Concupiſcence)</hi> here ſignifieth actuall luſt, euen actuall euill thoughts and deſires; and by all manner of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, the Apoſtle meanes all ſorts of euill motions, ariſing from the corruption of nature, contrary to the loue of God and the loue of Men, and againſt both the firſt and ſecond Table of the Commandements; <hi>For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law,</hi> that is, Without the knowledge and due conſideration of the Law, <hi>Sinne is dead,</hi> or was dead, that is, the corruption of nature lay hid, and was not knowne to be ſinne, or did not ſo ſtrongly and ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke; it was, as it were, dead, in compariſon of that ſtrong working it had, after the Law was knowne and duely conſidered. That this is the meaning, is cleere by the Context: for the Apoſtle ſaith, hee knew not luſt to be ſinne, till he came to looke into the Law of God, and duely to conſider it, and that ſinne tooke occaſion by the knowledge, and due conſideration of the Law, to rage and ſwell, and to breake out into all manner of euills. Thus then conceiue wee the Apoſtles meaning in this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law indeed is not the cauſe of ſinne, but yet the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature being ſtirred vp by the knowledge and due conſideration of that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement that forbids luſt, though no occaſion of ſinne was thence giuen, yet the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereby taking occaſion to rage and ſwell, and to breake
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:422:88"/> out, it effected and brought forth in me, being yet in my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtate and condition, all ſorts of euill motions, contrary to the loue of God, and contrary to the loue of Men; for without the knowledge and due conſideration of the Law, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature was, as it were, dead, it lay hid, and did not ſo ſtrongly and fiercely worke as afterwards, when the Law was knowne, and duely conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Sinne tooke occaſion by the Commandement:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Such is the prauitie and peruerſneſſe of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it takes occaſion to breake out on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God.</note> the corruption of nature on the Commandement tooke occaſion to be ſtirring and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to rage, and ſwell, and to breake out more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wee may eaſily ſee and conceiue the greatneſſe and ſtrong working of the corruption of nature; ſo great is the corruption of nature, and ſuch is the prauitie and peruerſneſſe of it, that it takes occaſion to breake out on the Commandement of God, and the more the holy will of God is reueyled and knowne, the more doth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature rage, and ſwell, and breake out into ſinne: the wicked nature of man is this; The more he is forbidden to doe any thing, the more and the rather hee deſires and ſeekes to doe it. In this, the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is like the Gangrene, the Leproſie, the <hi>Noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> and ſuch diſeaſes as are made worſe, by ſuch things as ſhould be a meanes to cure them. And as a violent ſtrong ſtreame of water, if you roule a great ſtone into it, or make a damme or banke in the midſt of it, the higher it riſeth, and the more it roares and ſwells, and breaks ouer with greater violence; ſo it is with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and peruerſe nature of man, the more it is oppoſed by the holy Law of God, and the more that it is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as a banke to keepe it in; the more doth it rage and ſwell, and the more it breakes out into ſinne; and the more a thing is forbidden, the more doth the corrupt mind of man giue it ſelfe to the doing of it.</p>
               <p>VVe may ſee this cleerely in the example of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; wee find, that when the Lord commanded them,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:422:88"/> and inuited them by many ſweet promiſes to go into the Land of Canaan, then they would not goe into it, they diſpraiſe it, they murmure againſt God, and they like E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt better, they deſire to returne thither againe, <hi>Num.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 14.2, 3, 4.</note> 14.2, 3, 4. <hi>The children of Iſrael murmured againſt</hi> MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES <hi>and</hi> AARON, <hi>and the whole aſſembly ſaid vnto them, Would God we had dyed in the Land of Egypt, or in this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, would God we were dead.</hi> 3. <hi>Wherefore now hath the Lord brought vs into this Land, to fall vpon the ſword? our wiues and our children ſhall be a prey: Were it not better for vs to returne into Egypt?</hi> 4. <hi>And they ſay one to another, Let vs make a Captayne, and returne to Egypt.</hi> And a little after, when the Lord in the ſame Chapter forbids them to enter into the Land, then they would needes in all haſte goe thither. The Text ſaith, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 40. <hi>They roſe early in the morning, and gate them vp into the top of the Mountayne, ſaying, Loe, we be ready to goe vp to the place which the Lord hath promiſed: for we haue ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So againe, the Lord commanding them to ſacrifice to him on his owne Altar onely, their corrupt minds carry them to doe otherwiſe, and to ſacrifice to him in euery place. When circumciſion was commanded of God, all Nations lothed it, but when it was aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, then they would needes take it vp as a thing needfull to ſaluation: and therefore the Apoſtle bent himſelfe ſtrongly againſt it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Behold, I</hi> PAVL <hi>ſay vnto you, that if yee be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing. For I teſtifie againe to euery man which is circumciſed, that he is bound to keepe the whole Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe wee might adde many like examples cleering and confirming this truth: That ſuch is the peruerſneſſe of our nature, that it takes occaſion to breake out on the Commandement, and ſuch is the wicked nature of man, that the more a thing is forbidden, the more his corrupt mind is ſet on it, and the more hee giues himſelfe to the doing of it. And doe wee not ſee this in common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:422:89"/> Are there not many, who the more they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of their euill courſes, and the more they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from euill, the more their corrupt hearts are ſet on euill, and the more eagerly they follow it? Is it not ſometimes the ſpeech of a blaſphemous Swearer, being iuſtly admoniſhed and reproued for his ſwearing, he will therefore ſweare the more? And is it not thus with ſome beaſtly Drunkards, being told of their drunkenneſſe, and iuſtly reproued for it, doe they not thereupon giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more and more to the practice of that ſinne? I wiſh it were not thus with too many: but alas, it is too cleere, it is the caſe of too many: yea, ſome there be, that the more their ſinnes are diſcouered and forbidden by the Word of God, the more deſperate they become in a courſe of euill, and ſay, Oh, we are the Goates, we are wicked, and wee ſhall be damned: and thereupon they ſet themſelues purpoſely to doe euill, their owne corrupt hearts carry them more violently to a courſe of ſinne.

               <p>Come wee now to the laſt words of this Verſe, <hi>For without the Law, ſinne is dead.</hi> In theſe words, as before we ſhewed, the Apoſtle addes a reaſon to his foregoing Propoſition.

Yet in the meane time, ſuch perſons as are ſo carryed on in ſinne, are in a fearefull caſe, and it is the caſe of too many.</p>
               <p>Are there not many that know the Word of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding ſinne, yea, that know the Word of God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their particular ſinnes, and haue often heard it vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt their particular ſinnes of Pride, of Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of Drunkenneſſe, of Sabbath-breaking, and ſuch like; and yet the corruption of their hearts carryes them on euen with violence and eagerneſſe, to the practice of theſe ſinnes? Surely, ſuch perſons are in a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

                  <hi>But I my ſelfe heretofore, when I was a Phariſe, and did not ſoundly vnderſtand the Law of God, nor duely conſider it, but contented my ſelfe with an outward obſeruation of it, thought my ſelfe, in regard of my ſpirituall ſtate and condition, exceeding well, and in a maruellous good caſe, I was ſecure, my conſcience neuer troubled me, and I thought my ſelfe farre from any danger of death and damnation: but when I came to a right vnderſtanding, and due conſideration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, that forbids Luſt, and condemnes it, then the corruption of my nature, the luſt of mine heart, ſhewed forth the life of it, then it began ſtrongly to worke, and to ſtirre, and to accuſe me, then I found my ſelfe, in regard of my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtate and condition, in a miſerable caſe, then my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accuſed me, and terrified me, and I ſaw my ſelfe guiltie of ſinne, and ſo vnder the curſe of the Law and wrath of God, and lyable to eternall death and damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt obſerue we, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that when hee was a Phariſe, and had no ſound knowledge of the Law of God, nor due conſideration of it, but reſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the outward obſeruation of the Law, then hee thought himſelfe aliue, hee then thought himſelfe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſpirituall ſtate and condition, exceeding wel, and in a maruellous good caſe. Now that which was the conceit and thought of the Apoſtle, is the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and thought of all naturall men being ignorant of the Law of God, or not duely conſidering it: and the point hence is this,</p>
               <p>That ſuch as are ignorant of the Law and Word of <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">It is the nature of ignorant perſons, to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in an outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods Law.</note> or doe not duely conſider it, they pleaſe themſelues exceedingly in an outward conformity to the Law of God, and if they carry themſelues orderly, and yeeld an outward conformity to the Law, and performe outward good things, they are highly conceited of themſelues, and they thinke they are in a maruellous good caſe, in reſpect of their ſpirituall ſtate and condition; it is the nature of ignorant perſons to bleſſe themſelues, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their outward good carriage and ciuill behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and to thinke themſelues, in reſpect of that, aliue to Godward, and without all queſtion in Gods fauour, and ſarre from any danger of death and damnation. This is the conceit of all ignorant perſons, euen of all ſuch as are not well acquainted with the Law and Word of God, or doe not duely conſider it. Wee ſee it here in the example of the Apoſtle; and to this purpoſe wee haue other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Word of God, as that of the Phariſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11, 12. wee there reade, that the Phariſe giues thankes to God, that he was not thus and thus, <hi>That hee was not an Extortioner, Vniuſt, an Adulterer, or as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican:</hi> but he did this, and he did that, <hi>Hee faſted, and hee gaue almes,</hi> and ſuch like. As if hee had ſaid in plaine termes, I thanke God, I carry my ſelfe orderly and well, and I doe good duties; and therefore I doubt not but that I am in a good caſe, and I am in the fauour of God, and I am farre from danger of death and damnation.</p>
               <p>And thus we read,

               <p>And this is the conceit of all ſuch as are vnacquainted with the Law and Word of God, or doe not duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; they thinke, if they liue ciuilly and yeeld only an outward conformity to the Law of God, and Will of God reueiled in his Word, they are in a maruellous good caſe, and they cannot be perſwaded, that they are in a bad caſe, and in any danger of death and damnation: and if you tell them that they are in danger of it, they will be ready to anſwere you, as the people did the Prophet,

Poore ſoules! they deceiue themſelues in their owne conceit; and here is the cauſe of their miſconceit, they are ignorant of the Law of God, or at leaſt conſider it not as they ought, they either know not, or they conſider not the ſtrict iuſtice of the Law of God, that it requires exact and perfect holineſſe, aſwell of heart as of life, and a perfection of loue both to God and Men: this they are either ignorant of, or they conſider it not.</p>
               <p>To come to ourſelues; <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Whence it is, that men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their ciuill carriage.</note> or doe not duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, they pleaſe themſelues exceedingly, in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformity to the Law, and if they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues orderly and ciuilly, they thinke they are in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous good caſe, in regard of their ſpirituall ſtate and condition? By this then we may eaſily ſee, whence it is that men are ſecure, and pleaſe themſelues in their ciuill carriage, and their outward conformity to the Law of God, and thinke, that in regard of that, they are in a maruellous good caſe, yea, that they are in the fauour of God, and free from danger of death and damnation.</p>
               <p>Surely, hence it is, they are ignorant of the Law and Word of God, or at leaſt, they conſider it not as they ought, they carry themſelues ciuilly in the world, and they doe good things, and becauſe they are ignorant of the Law of God, or doe not conſider, what that requires at their hands, therefore they thinke themſelues aliue to Godward and in very good caſe, yea, you ſhall hardly perſwade them that their caſe is miſerable, and that they are in danger of hell and damnation: deale with them, and tell them their caſe is fearefull and damnable; and they thinke it ſtrange, and you bring ſtrange things to their eares. What, they in a bad caſe? they in danger of hell and damnation? Surely no, it cannot be; they thanke the Lord, they carry themſelues orderly and ciuilly, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:422:100"/> none can iuſtly taxe them with any ſoule crime, they doe no man wrong, they pay euery man his owne: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay what you will, you ſhall neuer make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that they are in a bad caſe, that they are in danger of hell and damnation.</p>
               <p>Thus thouſands in the world are conceited of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not knowing, or at leaſt, not conſidering what the Law and Word of God requires at their hands; they bleſſe themſelues in their ciuill carriage, and their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformitie to the Law of God; and ſo, poore ſoules, they deceiue themſelues, and they are in a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable taking, and indeed, their caſe is far more miſerable, becauſe they ſee not their miſerie, and they are hardly brought to take notice of it: it is an harder matter to bring a ciuill man or woman to a ſight of their miſerie, then a Swearer and a Ruffian: for why? They take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be in a bleſſed caſe, they thinke all is well with them, and they are ſuch as Chriſt ſpeakes of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.7.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7.</note> They thinke they are iuſt, and in the fauour of God, and they need no repentance; and ſo they goe on in a bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhneſſe, and without all true ſenſe and feeling of their ſinnes; and they are like to a man that is dangerouſly and deadly ſicke, and feeles not his ſickneſſe, and ſo neglects the meanes of his recouery, and dyes without remedie. So they are dangerouſly ſicke in their ſoules, and they feele it not, and they goe on, neglecting the meanes of their good, and ſaluation of their ſoules; and ſo their caſe is miſerable, yea, I dare be bold to ſay, either God ſaith not true in his Word (which were blaſphemy once to thinke) or elſe ſuch as reſt in their ciuill carriage and behauiour, and thinke all is well with them, are in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable caſe: for marke what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Except your righteouſneſſe exceede the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſes, yee ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what was the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:422:101"/> Phariſes? Surely, an outward conformitie to the Law of God, and for that, they were admired, and in reſpect of that, held as petty Angels; and yet Chriſt ſaith, Except our righteouſneſſe exceed them, we ſhall neuer enter into the Kingdome of heauen. And therefore take notice of thy miſerable ſtate and condition, thou that pleaſeſt thy ſelfe in thy ciuill carriage, and thinkeſt all is well with thee. It is through ignorance of the Law and Word of God: or becauſe thou conſidereſt not what the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thee in his Word, and thou doſt but dreame that thou art aliue to Godward; when God awakens thee thou ſhalt finde thy ſelfe in a miſerable caſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take notice of it now in time, and know that God in his Word, requires of thee conformity to his Law and Word aſwell inward as outward, and that thy doing of outward good things, comes from a ſanctified ſoule, and proceed out of a pure heart, good conſcience, and faith vnfayned, and that they bee done in conſcience and obedience to the Commandement of GOD, and with a deſire to pleaſe him, and with a due reſpect to his glorie.</p>
               <p>In the next place, obſerue we the manner of ſpeaking, the Phraſe and forme of ſpeech here vſed by the Apoſtle. He ſaith, <hi>I once was aliue, without the Law.</hi> And againe, that the <hi>Commandement came to him</hi> (and <hi>when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement came</hi>) not meaning that hee was altogether without the Law, or that the Law was altogether abſent from him, (for hee had the Law, and was inſtructed in it at the feete of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 12.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.) but his meaning is this, that hee was in former time without the ſound knowledge and vnderſtanding of the Law, and did not duely and throughly conſider it, the Law came to him when he ſoundly vnderſtood it, and did due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider it.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle ſetting out his want of ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and due conſideration of the Law of God, vnder
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:422:101"/> this Phraſe and forme of ſpeech, <hi>He was without the Law,</hi> and againe, <hi>His ſound knowledge and through-conſideration of the Law.</hi> Vnder this forme of ſpeech, <hi>The Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came to him,</hi> wee are giuen to vnderſtand thus much:</p>
               <p>That men are as without the Law and Word of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> and as if they had not the Law and Word of God,
<note place="margin">Men are as without the Law &amp; Word of God, though they heare the ſound of it, when they doe not rightly vnderſtand it and duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it.</note> though they heare the ſound of it in their eares, when they doe not rightly vnderſtand it, and duely conſider it; ſuch as heare the Law and Goſpell, euen the whole Word of God, and haue it ſounding in their cares, and doe not rightly vnderſtand it, and duely conſider it, ſo as they feele the proper and powerfull effect and working of it in themſelues for their humiliation and comfort; it may be truly ſaid of them, that they are as without the Word of God, they are as if they had not the Word of God at all; as one that is blind, may be ſaid to be without the light of the Sunne, though the Sunne ſhine moſt cleerly round about him, and the beames of it fall on his eyes; and as a man that hath riches, and yet hath not the vſe of them, nor any further profit of them, then the beholding of them with his eyes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. may be ſaid to be as without riches, and as if hee had no wealth at all. So they that haue the Word of God, and they heare it, they reade it, and it may be haue ſome generall and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed knowledge of it, and yet haue not the right and ſound vnderſtanding of it, and doe not throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, ſo as they feele the power and working of it in themſelues to their humbling and ſtrengthning; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they are as without the Word of God, as if they had it not at all.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe marke what the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Word that they heard, profited them not, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in thoſe that heard it.</hi> The meaning is this, Becauſe the Iewes, in the time of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did not ſoundly vnderſtand the Word of God, the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:422:102"/> Goſpell that they heard, and did not mingle it with faith, becauſe they did not ſo throughly and duely conſider it as they ought, euen till they come to feele ſweetneſſe and comfort of it in themſelues; therefore it was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, it was vnprofitable to them, and they were as without the Word of God, and as if they had neuer had it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.9. we read, that the Prophet conteſteth with the people, and blames them exceedingly, that though the Lord had ſent his Word vnto them by his Prophets, and they had heard it, yet they had no ſound knowledge and vnderſtanding of it, and he ſaith, in that regard they were as Babes, and the preaching of it had done them no more good, then as if it had beene preached to yong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: and ſo it was with them, as if they had been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preaching of it, and as if they had neuer heard it at all. <hi>Whom,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>ſhall he teach knowledge? and whom ſhall he make to vnderſtand the things that he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth?

               <p>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. Wee find, that Chriſt inioynes a diligent Search of the Scripture, that men ſhould againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſearch into the Scriptures: for ſo the word ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and neuer reſt till they finde out the right ſenſe and

Chriſt knowing well, that if men doe not ſo vnderſtand the Word, and if they be not able ſo to make vſe of it, they are as if they were without the Word, and as if they had it not at all. And the reaſon of it is this:</p>
               <p>Howſoeuer the Word of God be in it ſelfe the Will and Wiſedome of God reueiled; <label type="milestone">

                  </label> yet it is not ſo to them that doe not rightly vnderſtand it, and rightly apply it. The Word of God, miſvnderſtood, or miſapplyed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, it is not the Word of God to him; though in it ſelfe it be, yet to him it is not the Word of God, but his owne fancy, and his owne conceit. And therefore this muſt needes be held as a certayne truth, that men are as without the Word of God, though it ſound in their eares, and they haue ſome generall knowledge of it, when they doe not rightly vnderſtand it, and duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, ſo as they feele the proper effect and working of it in themſelues.</p>
               <p>This being a truth, the vſe of it is for inſtruction: <label type="milestone">

And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many deceiue themſelues; they reſt only in the hearing of the Word, and content themſelues with ſome general knowledge, they know onely the outward face and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Word, and they are able to repeate it, but they haue no ſound knowledge of it, they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the inward purpoſe and meaning of the holy Ghoſt in it. Poore ſoules! whoſoeuer they be that thus doe, they deceiue themſelues, and they are as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word of God, and as if they had it not at all, yea, on them is verified that heauy and fearefull threatning

               <p>Let vs not then content our ſelues with the hearing or reading of the Word of God, and with a generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, but labour we for the right vnderſtanding of it, and let vs neuer reſt till we come to a right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Word of God, and be able duely to conſider it, yea, ſo, as we feele the proper effect and working of it in our ſelues.</p>

               <p>Firſt, nothing is able to yeeld vs true comfort in time of trouble and diſtreſſe, but only the Word of God; and if we be not able to comfort our ſelues out of the Word of God in our troubles, we either grow impatient, or we become deſperate, or wee flye to vnlawfull meanes: for indeed if men know not God in his Word, they know not his Mercy, they know not his Truth, his Loue and his Goodneſſe; and how then can they poſſibly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in their troubles?</p>
               <p>Againe, conſider wee, that Prayer brings a feeling of comfort, and the Sacraments a ſealing vp of comfort, but it is only of that comfort wee haue in the Word of God: If wee haue no comfort in the Word of God, Prayer brings no feeling of any true comfort, the Sacraments ſeale vp nothing to vs, but Iudgement and Damnation. If we deſire to find true comfort in time of trouble and diſtreſſe, and would haue Prayer to bring vs to a feeling of true comfort, and the Sacraments to ſeale vp true comfort in our owne ſoules: let vs not content our ſelues with the hearing or reading of the Word of God, and with a generall knowledge of it, but labour we, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer let vs reſt, till wee come to a right vnderſtanding of the Word, and that we be able duely to conſider it, and that wee feele the proper effect of the Law in our owne hearts, to the humbling of vs for our ſinnes: and the Goſpell rayſing vs vp with true comfort, yea, that wee are able to finde comfort in the Goſpell in time of our greateſt trouble and diſtreſſe, then we rightly vnderſtand and duely conſider it: and if it be not thus with vs, wee
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:422:104"/> are as without the Word of God, and as if wee had it not at all.</p>
               <p>Note we further, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement came;</hi> meaning, that Commandement that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids Luſt, and condemnes it; when hee came more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to looke into that Commandement, and more duely to conſider it; thereby intimating, that in former times hee did not ſo narrowly looke into that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, nor ſo throughly conſider as hee ought. And hence we are taught,</p>
               <p>That we are carefully to conſider, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> and to looke into all and euery Commandement of God,
<note place="margin">We are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euery Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</note> euen to conſider one Commandement of God aſwell as another, and all of them together; for indeed <hi>he that breakes one Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is guiltie of all, Iam.</hi> 2.10. And there is the ſame Law-giuer of one Commandement, as well as of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; hee that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> as it followeth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, &amp;c.</hi> And the leaſt breach of any Commandement, is a ſinne againſt God, euen againſt the infinite Maieſtie of God, and ſo deſerues the wrath of God and euerlaſting perdition.</p>
               <p>And therefore wee are carefully to conſider all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Commandement of God, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Art thou no Thiefe, no Murderer, no Adulterer, no Swearer, and ſuch like? and yet art thou a Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker, or the like? thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe: thou canſt find no true comfort in ſo doing. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.6. <hi>He ſhould not be confounded, when he had reſpect to all the Commandements of God.</hi> Thus muſt wee doe, wee muſt haue reſpect to all the Commandements of God, and we muſt be careful to obey God in al his Commandements,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:422:104"/> otherwiſe wee ſhall finde no true comfort nor peace to our owne ſoules.</p>
               <p>Now further, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that whereas before without the Law he thought himſelfe aliue, and on the comming of the Commandement ſinne reuiued, and he dyed, his meaning being this, that when he came to a true vnderſtanding of the Commandement of God that forbids luſt, and more throughly to conſider that Commaundement, then the corruption of his nature ſhewed foorth the life of it, it began then to ſtirre, to worke, and to accuſe him, and then he found himſelfe, in reſpect of his ſpirituall ſtate, as a dead man, he ſaw himſelfe guiltie of ſinne, and ſo vnder the curſe of the Law. Hence we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much:</p>
               <p>That the ſound knowledge and due conſideration of the Law of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label>
                  <note place="margin">Sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law of God, brings men to a ſight of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> brings men to a ſight of inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it makes men ſee that corruption in themſelues they ſaw not before, and it makes that to accuſe them and to condemne them; ſuch as carry themſelues ciuilly and orderly, and are of ciuill carriage and good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if ſo be they looke into the Law of God, and duely conſider that, and compare themſelues with that, they ſhall ſee themſelues vile wretches, and they ſhall ſee their ſoules polluted and defiled with many foule and groſſe ſinnes which they ſaw not before their carefull looking into the Law of God, and their due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that, will bring them to a ſight of many foule hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den corruptions, and to a ſight of ſuch ſinnes as they ſaw not before.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with the Apoſtle, when he had no ſound knowledge and due conſideration of the Law of God, he thought himſelfe aliue, and in very good caſe, but when he came more narrowly to looke into the Law of God, and throughly to conſider that, then hee ſaw the filthyneſſe and corruption of his owne heart; then hee ſaw himſelfe guilty of ſinne, which before hee had no
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:422:105"/> ſight of, then the luſt of his heart ſhewed forth the life of it, both in ſtirring and working, and in accuſing, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was then touched with that which neuer trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him before.</p>
               <p>And thus we read of the Iewes, <hi>Acts</hi> the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> preached to them, they were ſecure, they had no manner of inward touch of conſcience for that foule ſinne of crucifying Chriſt the Lord of life: no, it is ſaid, <hi>Verſ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>And hence it is,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25</note> that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 24, 25 that the Word of God diſcouering ſinne, being truely preached, the ignorant man and vnbeleeuer, one that hath no ſight of the hidden corruption of his owne heart, hearing it and duely conſidering it, he finds his ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, his conſcience iudged, and the ſecret corruption of his heart made manifeſt, and hee comes to ſee that in himſelfe, which he ſaw not before, hee is rebuked, and ſo the ſecrets of his heart are made manifeſt: And indeede the reaſon of it is this,</p>
               <p>The Law of God being the perfect rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> and requiring exact and perfect obedience to Gods will, reueiled as well in mans nature, as in his actions, &amp; forbidding the contrary, it is as a glaſſe that wil plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew what men are both within and without, what they are both in their hearts, and in their liues, and that without flattery and without partiality: and therefore it muſt needs be a truth, that if men ſoundly vnderſtand,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:422:105"/> and duely conſider the Law of God, it will certainely bring them to a ſight of Inward corruption, and make them ſee that corruption in themſelues which they ſaw not before; and, if men carefully looke into the Law of God, and compare themſelues with that, they ſhall ſee their ſoules filthy, and defiled with many foule &amp; groſſe corruptions and ſinnes which they ſaw not before.</p>
               <p>By this, in the firſt place we may eaſily ſee, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>
                  <note place="margin">Whence it is that many ſee not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their owne hearts.</note> whence it is that many in the world ſee not the inward luſts and corruptions of their owne hearts, their hearts abound with many groſſe corruptions and luſts, and they are full of enuy, of pride, of couetouſneſſe, they are ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, they are earthly-minded, they are ſet on the world and the things of it, euen to ſeeke their owne eaſe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profit, and the like, and they ſee not theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and luſts, their conſciences are neuer troubled with them, they goe lightly vnder the burden, and why? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, here is the cauſe of it, they doe not foundly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Law of God, at leaſt, they conſider it not as they ought, they neuer lay their hearts to the rule, euen to the Law of God; and that is the cauſe that they ſee not the foule and groſſe corruptions of them. And hence it is, that ſuch perſons as moſt carefully looke into the Law of God, and moſt duely compare themſelues with that, doe moſt of all others ſee their owne inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and are moſt of all humbled vnder the waight of them.</p>
               <p>The world thinkes, that ſuch as they call Puritanes, hold themſelues pure and free from ſinne. But (alas) they are deceiued, they, of all others, doe moſt of all ſee their owne inward corruptions, and doe moſt of all grone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of them, they ſee the vanitie of their minds, the rebellion of their wils, and that their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are exceedingly diſordered, and they haue much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe with their owne hearts, and they often complaine of their ſinfull infirmities, and why? Becauſe indeede they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:422:106"/> ſoundly vnderſtand the Law of God, and duely and throughly conſider it, and that brings them to a ſight of inward corruption, and makes them ſee thoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſinnes in themſelues, which the world takes no notice of. And they find it true in themſelues that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I haue made mine heart cleane, I am cleane from my ſinne?</hi> that is, I am with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reliques of naturall corruption. They find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vile wretches, in regard of their finnes, becauſe they looke narrowly into the Law of God, and compare themſelues with it.</p>
               <p>And ſo for a ſecond vſe of this doctrine. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Is it ſo, that ſome vnderſtanding and due conſideration of the Law of God will certainely bring men to a ſight of inward corruption,
<note place="margin">How men may come to know themſelues what they are within aſwell as without.</note> and make them ſee that corruption in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues which they ſaw not before? Surely then, if wee would know our ſelues what wee are aſwell within as without, and not deceiue our ſelues, nor pleaſe our ſelues in a falſe conceit, we muſt looke our ſelues in the glaſſe of Gods Law. If thou wouldſt be acquainted with thine owne heart, &amp; willingly ſee the hidden corruption of it, euen that which thou ſeeſt not in thy ſelfe, and as yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer troubled thee, then bring thine heart to the rule, the Law of God, and compare thy ſelfe with that, and that will certainely diſcouer to thee the foule and vgly face of thine owne heart, and let thee ſee that there is nothing but vanitie in thy mind, rebellion in thy will, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed diſorder in all thy affections; that there is nothing in thee of thy ſelfe, but the vgly ſhape of the Deuill, and that will driue thee from ſelfe-loue, and ſelfe-liking, and out of all conceit of thy ſelfe, yea, it will make thee not only deny thy ſelfe, as Chriſt commands, but euen to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre thy ſelfe, repenting in duſt and aſhes, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>Iob</hi> 42.6. Yea the more narrowly thou lookeſt into the Law of God, and the more thou doſt compare thy ſelfe with that, the more vile thou wilt ſee thy ſelfe, and the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:422:106"/> more will the filthineſſe and corruption of thine heart appeare to thee. And therefore if thou deſire to bee throughly acquainted with thine owne ſelfe, and wouldſt ſee aſwell what is within thee as without thee, that thou maiſt be truly humbled for thy corruptions and ſinnes of thine heart, aſwell as thy life, which is the onely way to true comfort and peace of conſcience: then labour for ſound vnderſtanding of the Law of God, and duely and throughly conſider that, and compare thy ſelfe with that; that is the way to bring thee to that thou deſireſt.</p>
               <p>Further obſerue we, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When the Commandement came, ſinne reuiued,</hi> and not onely ſo, but he addes, <hi>That he dyed,</hi> the Commandement of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoundly vnderſtood, and duely conſidered of him, the corruption of his heart, which before lay hid, beganne ſtrongly to accuſe him, and then he ſaw himſelfe guiltie of ſinne, which before he ſaw not, and not onely ſo, but thereupon alſo he found himſelfe, in regard of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall condition, in a miſerable caſe, as a dead man, vnder the curſe of the Law and wrath of God, lyable to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death and damnation. Hence wee are plainely taught,</p>
               <p>That the Law of God doth not onely diſcouer ſinne, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Thus alſo is it taken, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.13. <hi>They had a great while agone repented, ſitting in ſack-cloth and aſhes:</hi> that is, They had long ſince beene humbled and grieued for their ſins, and had teſtified their ſorrow, by ſitting in ſacke-cloth and aſhes. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> that is, Be humbled, and let thine heart be grieued for this thy wickedneſſe. So, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. <hi>I fcare,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>when I come againe, my God abaſe mee among you, and I ſhall bewaile many of them which haue ſinned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and haue not repented of the vncleanneſſe, and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wantonneſſe which they haue committed:</hi> that is, They haue not bewailed, grieued and ſorrowed for it. <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.6. <hi>No man repented of his wickednes, ſaying, What haue I done?</hi> that is, No man was diſpleaſed with himſelfe, and no man ſaid, Alas, what haue I done? And ſo in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places we find, that Repentance is taken for ſorrow, griefe, and vexation of heart for things done amiſſe, and for the breaking of the heart. Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. and thus it is ſaid that <hi>Iudas</hi> repented, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.3. Did <hi>Iudas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? did he turne from his ſinne to God? Nay rather,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:422:108"/> he ran from God, hee was full of horror, feare, anguiſh, and griefe, he was ſorry for that hee had done, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with horror.</p>
               <p>Againe,
<note place="margin">Diuers accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word (Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.)</note> the word <hi>(Repentance)</hi> ſometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſignifies not only contrition of heart, but it compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo vnder it the whole conuerſion of a ſinner, and it ſignifies both contrition and ſorrow for ſinne, and faith in Chriſt, and a thorow turning from ſinne to God. Thus <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.4. It is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> preached the baptiſme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for remiſſion of ſinnes, that is, he preached that men ſhould be humbled for their ſinnes, and beleeue in Chriſt, and thorowly turne to God, and ſo repenting, and ſo beleeuing in Chriſt, that they ſhould be baptized, and thereby teſtifie and ſeale yp the remiſſion of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And that vnder Repentance, faith in Chriſt is here to be vnderſtood, it is cleere, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.4. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,

Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>hee came not to call the righteous, but the ſinners to Repentance:</hi> meaning this, to turne ſinners from ſinne to God, that they might be conuerted, and beleeue in him, and be ſaued, as 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>This is a true ſaying, and by all meanes worthy to be receiued, that Chriſt Ieſus came into the world to ſaue ſinners.</hi> And we reade, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.20.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 26.20.</note> that repenting and turning to God are ioyned and put together, as one expounding the other, but ſhewed firſt, that they ſhould repent and turne to God.

               <p>Thirdly, the word <hi>(Repentance)</hi> is ſometimes put, to ſignifie the markes of Repentance, or new obedience, as <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.5. ſaith Chriſt to the Church of Epheſus,

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:422:109"/> by the word <hi>Repent,</hi> namely, doing of the firſt workes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the word <hi>(Repentance)</hi> is ſometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture put for the good things that follow true conuerſion, and turning to God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31.</note> and beleeuing in Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles ſay, that <hi>God lift vp Chriſt with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Sauiour, to giue Repentance to Iſrael:</hi> that is, to giue Iſrael reconciliation with God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18.</note> and to giue them his holy Spirit. So <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. the Church ſpeakes thus in <hi>Peters</hi> Apologie, in going to the Gentiles: <hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted Repentance vnto life:</hi> that is, accepted them for his, and made them alſo members of his Church, and adopted them for his children.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, not to adde any more, though more might be added, that the word <hi>(Repentance)</hi> is diuerſly taken in the Scripture, and hath not alwayes one and the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification: and this is that which deceiues ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or at leaſt will not diſtinguiſh of things that differ; they think it is euer to be taken in the ſame ſence and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and ſo they deceiue themſelues.</p>
               <p>Now whereas I ſaid, that Repentance properly taken, (that is) a turning from ſin to God, or a thorow change of the purpoſe of the heart, and courſe of life from euill to good, is neuer found in any but in true beleeuers, &amp; ſo muſt needs follow faith in Chriſt, in the order of nature, and muſt needs be the proper effect &amp; fruit of the Goſpel; I confirme that poſition, &amp; make it good by theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Reaſons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance properly taken, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low faith in the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> no man repents ſoundly, that is, ſoundly turnes from ſin to God, vnleſſe he deny himſelfe, &amp; hate ſin from his heart, and willingly imbrace true holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: And this none can or will in any meaſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, vnleſſe he be regenerate; for no vnregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hates ſin from his heart; &amp; none is regenerate, vnleſſe he be in Chriſt; and none is in Chriſt, vnleſſe he embrace Chriſt by a true iuſtifying &amp; ſauing faith; and true iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith is euer grounded &amp; faſtned on the promiſe of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:422:109"/> Goſpell, touching Gods free grace &amp; fauor in Chriſt, and free remiſſion of ſins: and ſo, without queſtion, it is the proper effect of the Goſpell; and therefore it muſt needes be, that true, ſound, and ſauing Repentance followes faith in Chriſt, and is the proper effect and fruit of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Baptiſme is doubtleſſe a Sacrament of the new Teſtament, and of the Couenant of Grace and of the Goſpell only, &amp; it ſeales vp that ſaith that is wrought by the preaching of the Goſpell, as appeares in many places of
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.</note> Scripture. And Baptiſme is alſo a ſigne and ſeale of true Repentance.
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3.</note> IOHN <hi>came preaching the baptiſme of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38.</note> 
                  <hi>Amend your liues &amp; be baptized euery one of you, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and yee ſhall receiue the gift of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And therefore Baptiſme belonging only to the Goſpell, and ſealing that faith that is wrought by the preaching of the Goſpel, and that being alſo a ſeale of Repentance, it cannot be, but that true Repentance is the proper effect and fruit of the Goſpel, and followes true faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſound &amp; ſauing Repentance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the promiſe of grace &amp; remiſſion of ſins, are inſeparable, they euer go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the promiſe of Grace and remiſſion of ſins is made to ſuch as apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Chriſt the Mediator, by true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, &amp; that promiſe is propounded only in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and therfore true &amp; ſound Repentance is the proper effect &amp; fruit of the Goſpell, and followes faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, &amp; laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Scripture doth expreſly refer the preaching of true ſauing Repentance, only to the Goſpel, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is vpon me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jſai.</hi> 61.1.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore hath the Lord anoynted me, he hath ſent me to preach good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings vnto the poore, and bind vp the broken-hearted, and to preach liberty to the captiues, and to them that are bound, the opening of priſon.</hi> Mat. 3.2. <hi>Repent;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Kingdome if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is at hand.</hi> Mat. 9.13. <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but the ſinners to Repentance.</hi> And therefore true ſauing Repentance is the proper effect and fruit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:422:110"/> and followes true ſauing faith in CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons doe ſufficiently euince the truth of this Poſition, that Repentance properly taken, namely, a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from ſinne to God, or a thorow change of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart and courſe of life from euill to good, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found in any but in true beleeuers; and ſo is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect and fruit of the Goſpell, and followes true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and iuſtifying faith in Chriſt. And theſe may ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any that is not wilfully blind and wedded to his owne idle and ſelfe-pleaſing conceit.</p>
               <p>One thing is further offered vnto vs from the phraſe and forme of ſpeech here vſed. In that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Sinne reuiued, and he dyed:</hi> In that he tels vs that ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing, that is, ſinne now accuſing him, and his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now being touched, and troubled with the ſight of ſinne, which hee ſaw not before, thereupon hee dyed, hee found himſelfe as a dead man. Hence we are further giuen to vnderſtand thus much:</p>
               <p>That the accuſation of the conſcience for ſinne, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.14.</note> ſaith he, The Spirit of man will ſuſtayne his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: but a wounded ſpirit who can beare it. The mind of man being ſound and whole, will enable him to beare in ſome meaſure with patience, diſeaſes of body, or any outward calamitie: but a wounded ſpirit, the wound of the ſoule, the horror of a guilty and accuſing conſcience who can beare it?

And this we may ſee in the example of <hi>Cain,</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> of <hi>Belſhazer,</hi> and many others in the Booke of God.</p>
               <p>

And wee know, that <hi>Iudas</hi> being galled with the gripes of a guilty conſcience, his conſcience accuſing him for his ſinne, hee neuer reſted till he made a diſpatch of himſelfe; <hi>He went and hanged himſelfe, Matth.</hi> 27.5.

The word <hi>(orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)</hi> we find not in the Text originall, nor any word an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to it: for the Text runnes thus, <hi>And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, euen that ſelfe-ſame Commandement that was vnto life.</hi> But indeed it may well be ſupplyed, the Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it as needfull for the right vnderſtanding of it, the meaning being this:</p>
               <p>That Commandement that was giuen and appointed of God to this end and purpoſe, namely, vnto life. The word <hi>(Life)</hi> here ſignifies not onely eternall life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, propounded and promiſed to the perfect doers of the Law of God, euen to ſuch as ſhould perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and doe all things commanded in the Law of God,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:422:112"/> and auoid all euils therein forbidden, according to that, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Yee ſhall keepe my Statutes and my Iudgements,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.5.</note> 
                  <hi>which if a man doe, he ſhall then liue in them; I am the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5.</note> Which is cited by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. where he ſaith, <hi>Moſes</hi> thus deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, that the man which doth theſe things, ſhall liue thereby. I ſay, the word <hi>(Life)</hi> doth not onely ſignifie that life, namely, eternall life and ſaluation, but it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies alſo tranquillity of mind and conſcience, peace and comfort, and the well being of the ſoule in this life: for that is agreeable to the context and preſent purpoſe of the Apoſtle, as I ſhewed Verſe before, when hee ſaid hee was aliue. We are thus to vnderſtand him, that hee was quiet and at peace in himſelfe, he thought himſelfe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſpirituall ſtate, exceeding well and in very good caſe; and ſo indeede the word <hi>(Life)</hi> is here to be taken, not only for eternall life and ſaluation, but alſo for peace, comfort, tranquillity of mind and conſcience, and the well being of the ſoule in this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was found,</hi> that is, of mee my ſelfe, it fell out and it proued to be to me to death, and I found it ſo. Now the word <hi>(Death)</hi> is here oppoſed to the word life before expreſſed, and it ſignifies not onely eternall death and damnation, but alſo diſquietneſſe, and trouble of mind and conſcience, and a wretched miſcrable caſe in this life. And ſo the meaning of thoſe words <hi>(was found)</hi> is this; It fell out and proued to be to mee to the diſquiet and trouble of mind and conſcience, and made me liable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death &amp; damnation, and I found it ſo to be to me.</p>
               <p>Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that Commandement of God that forbids luſt, and condemnes it, euen that ſelfe-ſame Commandement that was giuen and ordayned of God, for the good of ſuch as ſhould yeeld perfect obedience to it, euen for the tranquillity of their minds and conſciences, and for the peace, comfort and well
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:422:113"/> being of their ſoules in this world, and for their eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſaluation in the world to come, fell out and proued to be to me, to the diſquiet and to the trouble of my mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and made me lyable to eternall death and damnation, and I found it ſo to be to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt obſerue we, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi> of God, euen that ſelfe-ſame <hi>Commandement</hi> that God gaue and ordayned to life, fell out to him to death, and was found to be to him to the diſcomfort of his ſoule in this world, and to make him lyable to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death and damnation in the world to come. Whence we eaſily take vp this concluſion,</p>
               <p>That the Word of God, euen that Word that God gaue, and appointed to be a Word of life and ſaluation; the ſame Word becomes to many, a word of death and damnation, and is found ſo to be to many; and that very Word of God, that is by Gods appointment, in the true and proper vſe of it, a Word of life &amp; ſaluation, is found to be to many, a word of death and damnation. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here affirmes it of the Law of God, and it is true alſo of the Goſpell. Though God gaue the Goſpell, and ordayned it for the bringing of men to beleeue in Chriſt, and ſo to life and ſaluation, and it is his arme and power to ſaluation,

               <p>So the Sacraments, which by Gods appointment, in

               </p>
               <p>I might inſtance in many other particulars, and ſhew that the ſame things, that by Gods appointment, in the true and proper vſe of them, are for the good of men, are found to be to the hurt of many, and fall out to many to their euill: and the reaſons of it are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, many are not capable of that good, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> that is to be found in ſuch things as God hath ordayned to be for the good of men, in the true and proper vſe of them, being vnregenerate,

So all things worke together for the worſt, to thoſe that are yet vnregenerate; and ſo they are not capable of that good that God ordaynes to be in the true vſe of good things.</p>
               <p>Againe; Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> many haue in their hearts ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poyſon, as it poyſons euery thing they meete with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:422:114"/> As a bad ſtomacke turnes the beſt meate into bad humours: ſo their corrupt hearts doe corrupt and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon euery thing they haue, and euery thing they meddle withall, and they peruert good things, and turne them to a wrong vſe; and the better gifts they haue of body, mind, or outward ſtate, the worſe they are, peruerting and abuſing thoſe good gifts. And therefore this wee may reſolue on as a certayne truth, that the ſame things that by Gods appointment, in the true and proper vſe of them, are for the good of men, are found to be to the hurt of many, and fall out to many to their euill and to their hurt.</p>

And herein many deceiue themſelues; they thinke, if they haue good things, they are happy; and if they haue abundance of wealth, they bleſſe themſelues, and thinke certainely they are bleſſed of God, and ſticke not ſometimes to ſay, that God hath bleſſed them with ſuch and ſuch things, and they doubt not but that they are in the fauour of God, and it ſhall goe well with them.

               <p>How is that, may ſome ſay? Surely, thus, wee muſt neuer reſt, till wee find that wee haue part in the merit of Chriſt, and that the good things that wee enioy, are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and pledges of GODS loue towards vs in and through him.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, we muſt labour for grace in our hearts to make a right vſe of thoſe good things, that wee may vſe them to the glory of God and good of our ſelues and others, and that they may be helps to further vs in the way of godlineſſe, and to eternall life and ſaluation; and then doubtleſſe we ſhall find them to be to our good and to our comfort.</p>
               <p>The next thing that comes to be conſidered, is this, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Commandement was ordayned to life:</hi> the proper and naturall end and vſe of the Law of God was life, that is, the Law was giuen of God, and orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the good of ſuch as ſhould perfectly obey it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the tranquillity of their minds and conſciences, for the well being of their ſoules in this life, and for their eternall happineſſe and ſaluation in the Life to come.

But here is the difference; the Law requires righteouſneſſe inherent and perſonall, and the Goſpell, that requires righteouſneſſe imputed, righteouſneſſe inherent in Chriſt, and made ours by apprehenſion and application of faith: and ſo it is a truth, that the way to life and ſaluation, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fulfilling of the Law of God, and Chriſt iuſtifies true beleeuers, not onely by his death and ſuffering, freeing them from the guilt and puniſhment of their ſinnes, but alſo by his perfect fulfilling of the Law of God for them, by his actiue obedience. Let it ſuffice to haue touched that in a word.</p>
               <p>The point I will ſtand on a little further offered to vs from hence, that the Law was giuen of God, and orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the good of ſuch as ſhould perfectly fulfill it, namely, for the tranquillity of their minds in this life, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:422:116"/> for their eternall happineſſe and ſaluation in the life to come, is this:</p>
               <p>That there is much comfort in doing the Will of God, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">There is much comfort in yeelding ſound and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> howſoeuer true beleeuers cannot in time of this life perfectly fulfill the Law of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exact rule and iuſtice of it in their owne perſons, yet doubtleſſe they fulfill it in Chriſt, Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fulfilled it for them; and their ſound &amp; ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Lawes &amp; Commandements of God, yeelds to them a proportionable comfort, euen ſound and true peace, and tranquillity of minde and conſcience in this life, and aſſurance of eternall comfort, happineſſe and ſaluation in the life to come; the Law of God is giuen and ordayned for the good of ſuch as perfectly fulfill it; both in this life, and in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Now true beleeuers perfectly fulfill the Law of God in Chriſt, as they are one with him by faith, and in their owne perſons they yeeld ſound and ſincere, though not perfect obedience to the Will of God reueyled in his Word, and that which is lacking and defectiue in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is ſupplyed by the perfect righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: and ſo, without queſtion, it yeelds to them much comfort, peace, and tranquillity of mind and conſcience in this life, and certayne aſſurance of eternall happineſſe and ſaluation in the Life to come, and the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo to reward it; and for this we haue further plaine euidence and teſtimony of Scripture.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here then is laid before vs, that the Law only occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſlue the Apoſtle, and that the proper cauſe of it, that the Commandement fell out to be to death to him,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:422:119"/> was his owne corruption. And ſecondly, that his owne corruption taking occaſion by the Commandement, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him, and ſo by the Commandement ſlue him. In theſe two things ſtands the general matter of this Verſe, <hi>For ſinne tooke occaſion by the Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe wordes wee haue, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. where I ſhewed the meaning of them: therefore I will not now ſtand on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery word particularly; we are thus to conceiue them, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid,
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> For the corruption of my nature, being ſtirred vp by the knowledge and due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Commandement of God, that forbids luſt, and condemnes it, though no occaſion was giuen from that Commandement, yet the corruption of my heart tooke occaſion on that Commandement to be ſtirring and working, and thereby deceiued me.</p>
               <p>Theſe words <hi>(Deceiued me)</hi> are diuerſly expounded. Some would haue the word <hi>(Deceiued)</hi> to be vnderſtood not of ſinne it ſelfe, but of the knowledge of ſinne, and the meaning to be this, that at length the Apoſtle percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, how farre he had beene deceiued, and came to know how farre he had beene led out of the way by ſinne. But indeed that is a forced Expoſition, and it offers violence to the Text and to the drift of the Apoſtle. The word <hi>(Deceiued)</hi> rather points out the proper effect of ſinne, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion by the Law, which is to deceiue; and that we may rightly vnderſtand it, know, the word here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>(Deceiued)</hi> comes from a word that properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to ſeduce, or to draw out of the way by enticement, by perſwaſion, or by inſinuation; as a Thiefe ſometimes perſwades a Traueller to leaue the ordinary way in which he is going, and to take ſome by-path, inſinuating with him, and perſwading him it is better, more eaſier, or more pleaſant for him, and ſuch like. And in this ſenſe we find the word vſed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let no man deceiue you with vaine words.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Let no man ſeduce you, and draw you out of the way, to the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:422:119"/> committing of thoſe ſinnes before named, perſwading with you that there is no ſuch danger in them, as I tell you of: his words are but wind, they are vaine wordes. Certainely theſe ſinnes pull downe the wrath of God on the children of diſobedience. I et no man therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to the contrary, and ſo deceiue you. That is the proper ſignification of the word; and ſo the meaning of the Apoſtle in this place is this, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>Sinne tooke occaſion by the Commandement, to be ſtirring and working in me, and inticed me, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me, not to obey the Commandement of God, but rather to yeeld to the luſts of mine owne heart, and to fulfill them, as things farre better and more pleaſant, yea, it inſinuated with me, that the more the things were forbidden and condemned, the more ſweet and the more pleaſant would be the doing of them, as it is <hi>Pro.</hi> 9.17.
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Stollen waters are ſweet, and hid bread is pleaſant.</hi> And by this meanes it drew mee out of the way of obedience to the Commandements of God, and to the committing of ſinne, and ſo deceiued me, and thereby ſlue me. <hi>(Thereby)</hi> that is, by the ſame Commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinne tooke occaſion by the Commandement, and deceiued me, and by the ſame Commandement ſlue me.</hi> The meaning of that is this; the ſame Commandement, I being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the breach of it, bound mee ouer to the curſe, and made me ſee my ſelfe lyable to the wrath of God, and to eternall death and damnation; and ſo, by the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſinne wounded my conſcience, and gaue a deadly blow to my ſoule, it ſlue mee ſpiritually. Thus then conceiue wee the meaning of the Apoſtle, as if hee had ſaid,</p>
               <p>For the corruption of my heart tooke occaſion on that Commandement of God, that forbids luſt, and condemnes it; though no occaſion was thence giuen, yet it tooke occaſion thereby to be ſtirring in mee, and it inticed mee, and perſwaded with mee, not to obey
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:422:120"/> the Commandement of God, but to yeeld to the luſts of mine owne heart, and to fulfill them, as things farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more pleaſant, yea, rather to doe things becauſe they were forbidden and condemned, as more ſweet and pleaſant in the doing of them; and by that meanes it drew me out of the way of obedience to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, to the committing of ſinne, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued me, and then by the ſame Commandement I being guilty of the breach of it, and thereby bound ouer to the curſe, and made lyable to eternall death, ſinne woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my conſcience, and gaue my ſoule a deadly blow, it ſlue me ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>Firſt here note wee, that the Apoſtle ſtill goes on in cleering the Law of God from all fault and blame. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſaid in the Verſe before, that the Commandement was found to be vnto him vnto death; In this Verſe hee cleeres the Commandement, and layes the fault and blame where it ought to lye, namely, on the corruption of his owne heart, that the corruption of his owne heart tooke occaſion to be ſtirring in him, and by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſlue him. Hence then wee may ſee, how wee may cleere the Law and the Word of God, though it proue and fall out to be to ſome a ſauour of death and damnation.</p>
               <p>The fault is not in the Law of God and in the Word of God, <label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">The Word of God cleered, though to ſome it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſauour of death.</note> but in the corruption of their owne hearts. This point we handled Verſe the eighth, and I will not now ſtand on it.</p>
               <p>In the next place obſerue wee, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Sinne tooke occaſion by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, and deceiued him,</hi> it inticed him, and perſwaded with him not to obey the Commandement of God, but to yeeld to the luſts of his owne heart, and to fulfill them as things farre better and more pleaſant, and ſo deceiued him, and drew him to the practice of ſinne.

               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the corruption of the heart deceiues men, and drawes them to the practice of ſin, by perſwading them, that ſome things forbidden in the Law of God are good and profitable; as ſome kinde of lyes, a little breaking of the Sabbath, and ſelling ſome little commodities on the Sabbath, and doing a little in the Morning or Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on that day, Vſury, and ſuch like.

               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the corruption of the heart deceiues men, and drawes them on to the practice of ſinne, by turning away their minds from thinking earneſtly on the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to ſinne;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3.</note> it makes men <hi>put farre away the euill day, and approch to the ſeate of iniquity, Amos</hi> 6.3. It makes them thinke that the ſinne is not ſo great, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:422:121"/> it ſhall haue no puniſhment, or but a ſmall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as the Deuill perſwaded <hi>Eue,</hi> that <hi>ſhee ſhould not dye at all, Gen.</hi> 3.4.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4.</note> But it makes them thinke that they ſhall keepe ſinne ſecret, or repent of it, and preuent the puniſhment, and ſo, in hope either of ſecreſie, or of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, it makes them bold to commit the ſinne. And theſe wayes eſpecially, beſides many other, doth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the heart deceiue men, and draw them on to the practice of ſinne. And ſo we ſee the truth of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: That the corruption of the heart is of a ſubtill and deceiuing nature, and no maruell: the reaſon of it is this:</p>
               <p>It is the brood and off-ſpring of the Deuill, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> and hee is full of all ſubtilty, a lyar and deceiuer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the father of lyes and of all deceit; and therefore it muſt needs be that ſinne is of a deceiuing nature.</p>
               <p>Now then this ſerues firſt, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Whence it is that ignorant perſons are eaſily drawne to ſinne.</note> that ignorant perſons are ſo eaſily drawne on the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of any ſinne, be it neuer ſo groſſe; ſurely, hence it is, The Deuill is a ſtrong and ſubtill enemy, and they haue alſo in their owne boſomes another enemy both ſtrong and ſubtill, the corruption of their owne hearts, that ioyneth hands with the Deuill, and they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them to oppoſe to the force and ſubtilty of thoſe enemies, they haue neither knowledge nor grace to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; for ſo long as they be ignorant, they are graceleſſe. <label type="milestone">

Surely, hence it is, though they be worldly wiſe, yet hauing no dram of true heauenly wiſedome, the ſubtill corruption of their owne hearts eaſily circumuents them, and goes beyond them, and draweth them vpon the practice of ſinne, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their worldly wiſedome.</p>

               <p>We are further to marke, that the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>(Sinne)</hi> that is, his owne corruption tooke occaſion by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to be ſtirring and working, and it deceiued

The Apoſtle ioynes theſe two together, as following one on the other, <hi>Sinne deceiued him,</hi> and <hi>Sinne ſlue him.</hi> Hence wee are giuen to vnderſtand thus much:</p>
               <p>That theſe two things euer follow one on the other, <label type="milestone">

And for this, wee haue plentifull euidence and teſtimony of Scripture:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 20.12, 13, 14.</note>

               <p>And thus ſpeakes <hi>Salomon</hi> of him that is drawne to the ſinne of adultery,

               <p>And to this purpoſe wee haue many examples in the Booke of God, as that of <hi>Achan, Ioſuah</hi> 7. he ſaith <hi>Verſ.</hi>

<note place="margin">The Law and Word of God is holy in three reſpects.</note> that the Law and Word of God is holy &amp; pure in three reſpects eſpecially, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of the Author of it, in reſpect of the matter of it, and in reſpect of the working of it.</p>

               <p>Know wee then,
<note place="margin">The Law and Word of God is iuſt in three reſpects. 1.2.</note> that the Law and VVord of God is ſaid to bee iuſt and righteous in theſe three reſpects: In reſpect of the Author of it: In reſpect of the matter of it: And in reſpect of the end and vſe of it, as, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it is iuſt and righteous, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in reſpect of the Author of it: becauſe it proceedes from God, who is moſt iuſt, yea perfect Iuſtice it ſelfe, and infinite in holineſſe and iuſtice, and with whom dwels no iniquitie at all.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Law and VVord of God is iuſt and righteous, in reſpect of the matter of it: becauſe the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:422:133"/> matter of it is the reuealed Iuſtice of God, it reueales the perfect Iuſtice of God and his Righteouſneſſe; it is the perfect Rule of all righteouſneſſe; it teacheth what is due to God, and what is due to man; and it giues to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that which is due; it promiſeth good to thoſe that are good; and it threatens ill to thoſe that are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; and that without reſpect of perſons; it makes knowne the iuſt and righteous will of God, without all flattery or partialitie.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Law and Word of God is iuſt and righteous, in reſpect of the end and vſe of it: becauſe it tends to this end, to make men iuſt and righteous; and as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>The whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe, That the man of God may bee abſolute, being made perfect vnto all good works.</hi> Yea the morall Law of God is able to iuſtifie ſuch as perfectly keepe and fulfill it, and the Word of God will certainely acquite, &amp; iuſtifie thoſe that beleeue it, and embrace it, and yeeld ſound obedience to it, and that, before the Iudgement Seat of the Lord.</p>
               <p>VVe ſee then, how, and in what reſpects the Law and VVord of God is iuſt and righteous; it proceeds from God, who is moſt iuſt, yea infinite in holineſſe and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; it reueales the perfect Iuſtice of God, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; it is the perfect Rule of righteouſneſſe, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching what of right belongs to God, and what alſo is due to men; it giues to euery one his due, promiſing good to thoſe that are good, and threatning ill to thoſe that are wicked, and that, without reſpect of perſons, and without all flattery and partialitie; and it tends to this end, to make men iuſt and righteous, euen to acquite and iuſtifie as many as truely imbrace it, beleeue it, and yeeld ſound obedience to it, and that, before the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of the Lord. And ſo we may certainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and reſolue on this, that the Law and VVord
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:422:133"/> of GOD is a moſt iuſt and righteous Truth.</p>
               <p>This being a truth, it muſt needes follow on this, <label type="milestone">

The Law of God requires that men in this life, yeeld perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it. It is a meere ſhift and deuice of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries the Papiſts, to ſay that men are not bound in this life to yeeld ſuch perfect obedience to the Law of God, as in the life to come (for ſo they diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene obedience to the Law of God in this life, and in the life to come.)</p>
               <p>They ſay there is a double obedience to the Law of God, and a double perfect fulfilling of the Law: one in time of this life, which is, when men loue GOD aboue all things and their Neighbour as themſelues: and the other in the life to come; and that is, when men loue God with all the heart and ſoule, with all the powers and faculties of the ſoule, and with all the ſtrength of all thoſe powers: that is their diſtinction. Indeed a very abſurd and fooliſh diſtinction, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite and contrary to the plaine euidence of Scripture: for when the Lord ſaith in the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might:</hi> to whom doth he ſpeake? onely to men glorified in heauen? No certainely: hee ſpeakes to all men, to ſuch as liue yet in this world, and alſo to them that are glorified in heauen; his Law is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and vnchangeable, and contaynes an eternall and vnchangeable truth and righteouſneſſe, yea one and the ſame truth and righteouſneſſe for euer: and there is one and the ſame rule of righteouſneſſe giuen to men glorified in heauen, and to men liuing here on the face of the earth: and it is very abſurd to ſay, that a man is not bound in time of this life to loue God with all his heart, and with all his ſoule, but only in the life to come: <q>For what man was bound to, <label type="milestone">

A Miniſter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing the Word of God, muſt ſpeake as God would ſpeake. And would God commend a man or a woman, in whom nothing was found worthy commendation?

               <p>Men commonly deceiue themſelues in the matter of iuſtice; they thinke they deale iuſtly and truly with men, if they pay euery one his owne, and owe nothing to any, when notwithſtanding they are Vſurers, and they ſticke not to defraud men, and to ouer-reach them in bargay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them, and make no conſcience of vſing falſe waights and meaſures. The Word of God will tell them another thing. And therefore if wee would be reſolued, what is iuſt and equall both in duties towards God and towards men, and what we may iuſtly do, and with good conſcience, in euery particular action, wee muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Law and Word of God.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the third and laſt Epithite and Title here giuen to the Law of God, that is, that <hi>it is good:</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The Law is good, and the Commandement:</hi> that is, as wee ſhewed; It commands only ſuch things as are good, and forbids all manner of euill, and it ſhewes men the good way in which they are to walke. And this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is a ſpeciall property of the Law and of the Word of God; the Word of God is ſuch a Truth, as teacheth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:422:136"/> good things, yea, whatſoeuer is taught, or promiſed, or threatned in the Word of God, is good, and whatſoeuer the Word of God forbids and condemnes, is certainely euill, &amp; cannot be iuſtified: and the Word of God ſhewes men what is good, euen the good Way, in which they are to walke to life and ſaluation. And for this alſo wee haue euidence and teſtimony of Scripture. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. ſaith the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Be yee changed by the renewing of your mind, that yee may proue what is the good will of God, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and perfect.</hi> He meanes the will of God reueyled in his Word,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8.</note> and he calls that <hi>The good will of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. The Apoſtle takes it for a knowne and confeſſed truth: ſaith he, <hi>We know, that the Law is good.</hi> And of the Goſpell, by a ſpeciall kind of excellency it is affirmed, that <hi>it is the good Word of God. Heb.</hi> 6.5. <hi>And haue taſted of the good Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to theſe wee might adde many other teſtimonies of Scripture, where this Epithite and Title <hi>(good)</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Law and Word of God. But as before, in handling the former Epithites of the Law and Word of God, ſo here alſo I hold it needfull, to ſhew how, and in what reſpect, the Law and Word of God is ſaid to be good, and to make knowne, why it is called the good Word of God. And to this purpoſe know, that the Law &amp; Word of God hath this Epithite and Title <hi>(good)</hi> giuen to it, in a threefold reſpect. The Law and Word of God is ſtiled with this title <hi>(good)</hi> in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the Author of it.
<note place="margin">The Law and Word of God is good in three reſpects.</note> In reſpect of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it. And in reſpect of the effect, and of the end and vſe of it, as firſt:</p>
               <p>The Law and Word of God is good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in reſpect of the Author of it, becauſe it comes from God, it is his Word, who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, the Fountayne of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and from whom comes nothing but that which is only good.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:422:136"/>
               <p>Secondly, the Law and Word of God is good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the matter of it: becauſe the matter of it is the wiſedome and will of God reueiled, whoſe will onely is good, and the rule of all goodneſſe, <q>and <hi>the will of all creatures in heauen</hi> or earth is ſo farre forth good, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                     </label> as it conſents and agrees with the will of God reueiled in the eternall Truth of his Word.</q> And the Word of God doth not allow of, nor beare with the leaſt euill that is, but condemnes all things that be euill, be they neuer ſo pleaſant, or neuer ſo profitable in the corrupt ſenſe and iudgement of men, and threatens iudgement againſt thoſe that are guilty of euill, and it commends all good things, and ſhewes men euery good way in which they are to walke, and it contaynes promiſes of many good things both temporall and eternall, both belonging to the body and to the ſoule, and concerning this life, and that life that is to come, to thoſe that yeeld obedience to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Law and Word of God is good in reſpect of the effect, and of the end and vſe of it: becauſe it makes men, of ill to become good; as an Inſtrument, it works grace and goodneſſe in them, it conuerts &amp; turnes a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from euill to good, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the ſoule.</hi> And the Word of God, as an inſtrument, workes in the heart true ſauing faith, and all other good graces of the Spirit, and <hi>makes men perfect to all good workes,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17.</note> and it tends to this end, to make Gods Elect partakers of the greateſt good in this life, namely, of true comfort in Chriſt, and true peace of conſcience, and of the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting good of their ſoules and bodies in the life to come. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>It is able to ſaue mens ſoules.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21.</note> And therefore <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.68. <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi> And 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. ſaith the Apoſtle to TIMOTHY, <hi>Thou haſt knowne the holy Scriptures of a child, which are able to make thee wiſe vnto ſaluation, through the faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:422:137"/>
               <p>Thus then we ſee how, and in what reſpects the Law and Word of God is ſaid to be good. It comes from God, who is Goodneſſe it ſelfe, and the Fountayne of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from whom nothing can come but Goodneſſe. It is the Wiſedome and Will of God reueiled, whoſe Will only is good, and the Rule of all goodneſſe, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes all euill whatſoeuer, threatning iudgement to them that are guilty of euill, and it commends all good things, and ſhewes men euery good way in which they ought to walke: It contaynes ſweet promiſes of many good things both temporall and eternall, made to thoſe that yeeld obedience to it, and as an inſtrument, it makes men, of ill to become good, turning them from euill to good, it workes true ſauing faith, and all other good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the heart, and it tends to this end, to make Gods Choſen partakers of the greateſt good in this life, and of eternall good in the life to come: and therefore certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Law and Word of God is a Truth that is truely good and euery way good.</p>
               <p>Now then this being ſo, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> it firſt diſcouers a deceit of the enemies of Gods Truth,
<note place="margin">A deceit of the Papiſts diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> the Papiſts. By this we may eaſily ſee, that they are no ſuch friends to good workes, as they would make the world beleeue they are; they ſeeme to carry a great zeale to good workes, and they pretend to be ſuch friends to good workes, as if none were like them, &amp; they open their mouthes wide againſt vs, as enemies to all good workes. But indeed, if the matter be well examined, we ſhall find none greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to good workes then Papiſts are. For why? They take order to keepe the people amongſt them, from the knowledge of Gods will reueiled in his Law and Word; they ſtraightly charge the people, on payne of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to reade the Booke of God; and they will not ſuffer them to haue the Scripture in their Mother tongue, in a Language knowne to them.</p>
               <p>Now then conſider it; Is the Law and Word of God
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:422:137"/> the Rule of all goodneſſe, ſhewing men euery good way, and teaching men what is good, and what is ill, and how good workes are to be done; and will they barre men from the knowledge of the Word of God, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to haue any acquaintance with it, and yet beare the world in hand, that they are the only friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers of good workes? Who is ſo ſimple, as ſees not their deceit? A man with halfe an eye may eaſily ſee, that their practice is in flat oppoſition to their words; they ſay one thing, and they practiſe another.</p>
               <p>And for the vſe of the point to our ſelues: Is it ſo, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> that the Law and Word of God is truly good?
<note place="margin">We muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Word of God to be euery way good.</note> Doth it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend all good things, and promiſe good to thoſe that yeeld obedience to it? and doth it condemne all euill, and threaten iudgement to thoſe that are guilty of euill? Is it good in the promiſes, and good in the threatnings of it? Surely then, it muſt be ſo acknowledged, and ſo eſteemed of vs; wee muſt acknowledge the Word of God to be good, in promiſing good things, and good alſo, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ill, and in threatning iudgement againſt thoſe that are guilty of ſinne, and aſwell good in the one, as in the other; yea, we muſt acknowledge the Word of God, applyed to the diſcouering, and to the condemning of our particular ſinnes, and the threatnings of it iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt vs for the ſame, to be the good Word of God.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Ezechiah, Iſai.</hi> 39.8. When the Prophet came vnto him, and told him of his particular ſinne in ſhewing his treaſures, and reprouing him for it, and let him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what euill the Lord would bring vpon him for that ſinne; ſaith HEZEKIAH, <hi>The Word of the Lord is good, which thou haſt ſpoken:</hi> I acknowledge the Word that thou haſt ſpoken, to be the good Word of God. Thus muſt we doe; we muſt acknowledge the Word in the miniſtery of it, diſcouering and condemning our ſins, and the threatnings of it applyed to vs in regard of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:422:138"/> thoſe ſinnes, to be the good Word of GOD.</p>
               <p>Now, herein men come too ſhort, and they faile. Let the Word of mercy, and the Word of comfort be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and preached, and euery one is ready to hale &amp; pul that to himſelfe, though it belong not to him, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that, and to eſteeme that to be the good Word of God. But let the particular ſinnes whereof men are guilty, be diſcouered and condemned in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and preaching of the Word, and Iudgements due to thoſe ſinnes be iuſtly denounced, and men thinke that the Word ſo applyed, is but the word of man, the word of the Preacher, and not the good Word of God; they will not acknowledge that, and eſteeme that as the good Word of God, but hold and deeme that to be the bare word of man.</p>
               <p>Well, let ſuch perſons know, that the Lord in his iuſt iudgement will deale with them proportionably. Doſt thou hold and eſteeme the Word diſcouering thy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſinnes, and condemning them, and threatning iuſt Iudgements againſt thee for them, to be but the word of man, the word of the Preacher, and not the good Word of God? <q>Aſſure thy ſelfe, the Lord in his iuſt Iudgement will puniſh thee in the ſame kind, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                     </label> and deale with thee accordingly in his Word of mercy, and in his Word of comfort; he will make his Word of mercy and comfort to thee, but the word of man, a vaniſhing word,</q> and a word that ſhall periſh with the breath of man; it ſhall not be the good Word of God to thee in time of neede; thou ſhalt then find no comfort in it. Remember the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of HEROD;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee heard</hi> IOHN, <hi>and did many things, and heard him gladly, Mar.</hi> 6.20. yet when <hi>Iohn</hi> told him of his particular ſinne, and reproued him for it, then he thought that was but <hi>Iohns</hi> word, and not the Word of God, and hee would be meete with <hi>Iohn</hi> for it. And ſo indeed, the Lord, in his iuſt iudgement, made all that <hi>Herod</hi> heard from <hi>Iohn,</hi> euen the things hee heard
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:422:138"/> gladly, and tooke great comfort in (as hee thought) to become vnprofitable to him, and the Lord ſuffered him to rot and periſh in his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Learne wee then to take heede of diuiding betweene God and his Word, when his Word diſcouers our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſinnes, and threatens Iudgements iuſtly againſt vs for the ſame: and if thinking the Word ſo applyed, to be but the word of man, and not the good Word of God, if wee ſo doe, wee may iuſtly looke, that the Lord ſhould make his Word of comfort, not to be his good Word to vs in the time of need, but only as the word of man. Let vs therefore acknowledge the VVord of God, both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing mercy and good things, and alſo iuſtly threatning Iudgement againſt vs for our ſins, to be the good VVord of God; and then doubtleſſe we ſhall find the comforts of it, made good to vs in time of need.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee, that the Apoſtle is put to anſwere a new cauill, and to wipe away a new calumny that ſome were readie to caſt on the good Law of God; there was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling againſt it before, and now againe. <label type="milestone">

               <p>The point I will ſtand on a little further, may thus bee gathered: we ſee that the Apoſtle is here put to anſwere a new ſlander, brought againſt the good Law of God,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:422:141"/> that the good Law of God ſhould be deadly, or the cauſe of death to him, and ſo a moſt vile and peſtilent thing: this, the Apoſtle is here put to wipe away from the good Law of God. The point hence is this:</p>

               <p>In the next place obſerue we, that the Apoſtle hauing propounded that abſurd cauill &amp; ſlander, that ſome were ready to charge on the Law of God, that the good Law of God ſhould be deadly, or the cauſe of death to him: hauing (I ſay) propounded that by way of Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Was that then which is good, made death to me?</hi> hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres it negatiuely, and that with a deteſtation, and an abhorring of ſuch ſoule concluſions: <hi>(God forbid:)</hi> far be it from vs ſo to thinke: oh, fie on it, that is a very abſurd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion. Hence we are giuen to vnderſtand thus much:</p>
               <p>That it is a very abſurd thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> it is a thing againſt all reaſon, to charge the good Law of God to be deadly,

The good Law of God is not to be charged to be the cauſe of any mans ſpirituall death; that doth not properly, as a working cauſe, wound the conſcience of any, nor of it ſelfe make any lyable to death and damnation. Indeed, the good Law of God iuſtly threatens death and damnation to ſuch as are guilty of the breach of it, the curſe of the Law being annexed to it, and this being ioyned to the Law, that <hi>curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Booke of the Law, to doe them:</hi> but yet it is a wrong to the Law, and an imputation falſly caſt vpon it, to ſay that it is the proper cauſe of death and damnation, and that it properly, as a cauſe, brings forth the wound of conſcience, or of it ſelfe makes any lyable to death and damnation.</p>
               <p>Wee know that the Lawes of the Kingdome threaten death to ſuch as are guilty of Treaſon, Murder, Theft, and other capitall crimes, and they condemne ſuch to death as are found guilty of thoſe crimes: but yet it were a wrong, and a ſlander falſly laid on the Lawes, to ſay that they, of themſelues, and as cauſes, make men lyable and ſubiect to death, and that they bring forth that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of themſelues. And ſo indeed <hi>the Law of God</hi> (as it is)

               </p>
               <p>Againe, the good Law of God being perfectly good, and euery way good, as before we ſhewed, it cannot of it ſelfe properly, as a working cauſe, wound the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any, or make any lyable to death and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore, to charge the good Law of God to be the proper cauſe of the wound of conſcience, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe of death and damnation to any, it is a wrong to the Law of God, and an imputation falſly caſt on it.</p>

               <p>This is the ſubtilty of Satan; and men that haue no loue nor liking to the Word of God, are ready to ioyne with Satan, thus to diſcountenance and to diſparage the reading and hearing of the good Word of God. Indeed it is true, that men, in reading &amp; hearing the good Word of God, are ſometimes brought to trouble of mind and conſcience. But what then? Is the reading or hearing of the good Word of God, the proper cauſe of that trouble? No, no: the proper cauſe of it, is their owne guiltineſſe of ſinne, the good Word of God read or heard, is a meanes to ſhew men their ſinnes and guiltineſſe; and thereupon they are wounded in ſoule, and troubled in mind and conſcience: and ſo their trouble in that kinde comes not from the Word of God, as the proper cauſe of it, but from their owne guiltineſſe of ſinne. A Phyſician ſhewes a man ſome dangerous diſeaſe in his body, that he knew not of before; and thereupon the man is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and much diſcouraged. Is the Phyſician the proper cauſe of that trouble and diſcouragement? Surely no. But the diſeaſe of his body now made knowne to him.

And therefore take wee heede of charging that on the good Word of God, on the reading or hearing of it, that indeed comes not from it; and let it be farre from vs to thinke that the good Word of God, or the reading or hearing of it, is the proper cauſe of trouble of mind, of madneſſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction. If we charge theſe things on the good Word of God, wee wrong it, and lay an imputation falſly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>Now touching the Apoſtles particular anſwer to that ſlander charged by ſome on the Law of God. In that he ſaith that <hi>ſinne,</hi> that is, the corruption of his nature, <hi>wrought death in him,</hi> that is, was ſtirred vp by the good Law of God; wee might hence ſhew the prauity and peruerſneſſe of the corruption of nature, that it takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſtirre, and worke, and breake out on the good Law of God. But that point we haue heretofore handled: therefore I paſſe by it.</p>

               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the corruption of his heart wrought death in him: Hence wee are plainely taught,</p>

               <p>By this we may eaſily conceiue the miſerable ſtate and <label type="milestone">

               <p>And ſuch is the ſtate and condition of all ſuch as are yet in their naturall condition; their owne wicked and corrupt hearts, being left to themſelues, doe worke their bane and deſtruction, not only by ſuch ſins as the world takes notice of to be dangerous and pernicious, but by the good and holy things of God.

               <p>In the next place obſerue wee, that the Apoſtle faith, <hi>Sinne wrought death in him by that which is good.</hi> He addes further, <hi>That ſinne might appeare ſinne,</hi> that is, as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the vile, filthy, and curſed nature of it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And he explaines that in the laſt words: <hi>And that ſinne might be out of meaſure ſinfull by the Commandement,</hi> that is, that ſinne might ſhew it ſelfe extremely euill, and vile, and moſt wicked and curſed ſinne, it breaking out againſt the good Commandement of God. The point hence is this:</p>
               <p>That then ſinne ſhewes it ſelfe moſt vile and filthy, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> and of a curſed nature indeed,
<note place="margin">Sinne is then moſt vile and filthy, when it breakes out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the meanes that ſhould keepe it in.</note> when it breakes out againſt that which is good, and ſhould be a meanes to keepe it in, then ſinne appeares moſt odious and foule, and it is a fearefull aggrauation of ſinne, and makes it out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſinfull, when it breakes out againſt the good meanes that ſhould reſtrayne it, and ſhould keep it in. And bence it is, that holy men of God, when they would make ſin, ſinne committed, to appeare moſt vile &amp; moſt foule, they haue laid it forth, not only as a breach and tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, but they haue further laboured to ſet it out, as a thing done againſt knowledge, againſt conſcience, againſt the good meanes of reſtraint, which the Lord had vouchſafed, yea, as a ſinne committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mercy of God, and they haue clothed it with the circumſtances of time, of place, of perſon, that might aggrauate the ſinne, and make it appeare more foule and more haynous.</p>
               <p>Thus dealt <hi>Nathan</hi> with <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. He not only told <hi>Dauid, Verſ.</hi> 7.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7.</note> that <hi>he was the man that had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> but he proceeded further, and told him, that <hi>he was the man whom the Lord had anoynted King ouer Iſrael, and deliuered out of the hand of</hi> SAVL, <hi>and had giuen him his Lords houſe, and would moreouer, if that had beene too little,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:422:146"/> haue giuen him ſuch and ſuch things:</hi> and that he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſecret and cloſe manner, as if <hi>Vriah</hi> had not beene kild by him, but that the ſword of the children of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had ſlaine him.</p>
               <p>Thus the holy Prophet laboured to make the vileneſſe of <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne to appeare, by bringing to his minde Gods mercy in his aduancement, his contempt of Gods Commandement, and his cunning dealing in committing of that ſinne.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17.</note> And thus dealt <hi>Samuel</hi> with <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17. He laid before <hi>Saul</hi> the Lords gracious dealing with him in his aduancement, in that when he was little in his owne ſight, the Lord made him Head ouer the Tribes of Iſrael, for the Lord anoynted him King ouer Iſrael, and thereby ſhewed him, that his ſinne was moſt vile, in ſparing <hi>Agag</hi> and the beſt of the Sheepe &amp; Oxen, in that his wicked heart had made him ſinne againſt ſuch mercies vouchſafed vnto him.</p>
               <p>And this aggrauation of ſinne wee finde vſed by the Prophet in expreſſe termes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.10. <hi>Let mercy be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the wicked, yet he will not learne righteouſneſſe: in the Land of vprightneſſe will he doc wickedly.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Herein appeares the vile &amp; curſed nature of the wicked, that though the Lord vouchſafe mercy to them, yet they will ſtill be wicked, and they will not learne to doe well; nay, in the Land of vprightneſſe, amongſt many occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and meanes of good, they will doe wickedly. And therein appeares the vileneſſe &amp; curſedneſſe of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature; and ſo the Prophet plainely confirmes this point, That then ſinne appeares moſt foule, and it is a fearefull aggrauation of it, and makes it out of meaſure ſinnefull, when it breakes out againſt the good meanes that ſhould reſtrayne it, when it breakes out againſt knowledge, againſt conſcience, againſt the mercies of of God, and the like. And the reaſon of it is this,</p>
               <p>Sinne breaking out againſt the good meanes that ſhould keepe it in, therein it ſhewes it ſelfe to be of the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:422:146"/> greateſt force and ſtrength; and the ſtronger it is being vile, the more vile it is, and therefore this wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as a certayne truth, that then ſinne appeares moſt foule, and it is a fearefull aggrauation of it, and then it is out of meaſure ſinfull, when it breakes out againſt the good meanes that ſhould reſtrayne it and keepe it in.</p>
               <p>Now then, this ſerues firſt to diſcouer to vs, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that the ſinnes of many in the world are moſt odious and moſt foule:
<note place="margin">The ſinnes of many diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be moſt odious and ſoule.</note> for indeede the ſinnes of too many want not this circumſtance of aggrauation, they are committed againſt knowledge, againſt conſcience, againſt the cleere light of the Word of God, and againſt the good meanes of reſtraynt the Lord hath vouchſafed vnto them. Can the Drunkard, the vncleane perſon, the proud perſon, can theſe and the like plead ignorance, or the want of meanes to reſtrayne them? No certainly, they cannot: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſinnes are committed againſt knowledge, and againſt conſcience, and ſo they are moſt vile and moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. The ſinne of Ignorance is not excuſable, becauſe men haue in them ſufficient light to leaue them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: but when men haue a further light giuen them, and ſinne againſt that, that is moſt ſearefull, and then is their ſinne out of meaſure ſinnefull; and without great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall find a proportionable puniſhment, euen more fearefull puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Againe, is it ſo, that ſinne is moſt foule and filthy, <label type="milestone">

Surely, then ſinne may iuſtly be taxed as more vile, in that reſpect that it hath beene committed againſt knowledge, againſt conſcience, againſt the good meanes, againſt the cleere light of the Goſpell, and againſt the euidence of Truth, that hath beene taught, and men are not to thinke much when their ſinnes are thus laid before them, with thoſe neceſſary circumſtances of aggrauation. Men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:422:147"/> thinke they are diſgraced too much, when their ſinnes are thus laid before them. But they muſt know, that this is the way to bring men to ſee the vileneſſe of their ſins, and to bring them out of loue and liking of them: Yea, this is the way to ſtrip men of all colourable excuſes, as of their owne infirmity, the example of others, or the like. For what ſhall a man be able to plead in defence of his ſinne, when his owne knowledge, conſcience, good meanes, and mercies of God vouchſafed vnto him ſhall plead againſt him, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken vnto them, they ſhould not haue had ſinne, but now haue they no cloke for their ſinnes.</hi>

Therefore ſinne muſt thus be laid before men, that the vileneſſe of it may appeare, yea, we are thus to acknowledge ſinne, and to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it to God, when wee humble our ſelues in the confeſſion and acknowledgement of our ſinnes. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Then in the wordes following, he ſpeakes of himſelfe, and ſets forth himſelfe as ſtanding in an oppoſite and contrary ſtate to the Law of God, and ſaith, that he was <hi>carnall,</hi> and he addes to that, <hi>Sold vnder ſinne. The Law is ſpirituall, but I am carnall, ſold vnder ſinne.</hi> And ſo he fals on the third and laſt part of this Chapter; hee makes an entrance and paſſage to it: which part is continued from this Verſe, to the end of the Chapter: and the ſumme of it is thus much: A troubled complaint of the Apoſtle, that though he were regenerate, &amp; had receiued a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace and ſanctification, yet through the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſinne ſtill abiding in him, he was farre from that he ought to be, and farre from that the Law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at his hands, and that he was euen carnall, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſpirituall nature of the Law of God: and ſo a ſetting forth, in his owne example, of the combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the fleſh and the Spirit, in them that are truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</p>
               <p>Now touching the combat betweene the fleſh and the Spirit in them that are truely regenerate: The Apoſtle firſt layes it forth in his owne example, from this 14. Verſe, to the 24. and then he ſhewes the iſſue of it, ſtill
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:422:148"/> inſiſting in his owne example, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24.25.</p>
               <p>The combat is laid forth in three degrees. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As firſt, in that he by ſinne was brought to doe that euill which hee would not, therein ſhewing an oppoſition betweene the Law commanding, and his will conſenting, and ſinne ouer-ruling him, and his fleſh obeying, and that is in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that hee was hindered by ſinne, from doing the good which he would: this is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. and proued: Firſt, by the contrary effects, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. and then by the contrary cauſe, the Law mouing to good, and he thereunto conſenting, and ſinne hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, <hi>

               <p>The third degree is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in that his delight was in good, touching the inner man, but yet was led captiue, by the Law of his members, to ſinne, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Then, touching the iſſue of this combat, the Apoſtle firſt deſires to be freed from this ſpirituall bondage and captiuity, <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. and then giues thanks for his freedome in and through Chriſt, in that in him he was thus far freed, as that hee was not wholly captiued to ſinne, but in his mind he ſerued the Law of God, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>And thus wee ſee the generall matter of the third and laſt part of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>In this 14. Verſe, as I ſaid, the Apoſtle yeelds a reaſon why the Law of God is not the cauſe of death: becauſe <hi>the Law is ſpirituall,</hi> deliuering that as a knowne truth, and then hee ſets himſelfe as ſtanding in a contrary ſtate to the Law, that <hi>he was carnall,</hi> and addes to that, that <hi>he was ſold vnder ſinne.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But I am carnall, ſold vnder ſinne.</hi> Some make queſtion, whether the Apoſtle here ſpake of himſelfe, as hee was now an Apoſtle and truly regenerate, or no.

                  <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> But yet he was in ſome reſpect carnall, as firſt, in reſpect of that perfect integrity, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, or (as I may ſo ſpeake) that ſpirituality that is taught and required in the Law of God; and doubtleſſe, this he intended, in ſetting theſe two one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpirituall and carnall. <hi>The Law is ſpirituall, but I am carnall.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, It is heauenly and diuine, it
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:422:149"/> requires Angelicall and diuine obedience: but alas, I come farre ſhort of that vprightneſſe, and that ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that the Law requires, I am euen carnall, in reſpect of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle was carnall, and might iuſtly ſay of himſelfe, that <hi>hee was carnall,</hi> in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect regeneration; that though hee were truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet he was regenerate but in part, not perfectly, and that hee was ſtill in part carnall, and had ſtill the relikes of originall corruption abiding in him, and carnall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſtill cleauing vnto him; as Ignorance, Vnbeliefe, Doubting, and the like.</p>
               <p>And thus wee are to vnderſtand the Apoſtle, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>he was carnall;</hi> that he was not ſo ſimply, and altogether as vnregenerate perſons be, but in reſpect of that vprightneſſe of the Law, and in reſpect of perfect regeneration.</p>
               <p>He addes further, <hi>(ſold vnder ſinne.)</hi> This Phraſe is borrowed from bondmen or captiues: and the Apoſtles meaning is, that hee was as a bondman or captiue vnder ſinne, the corruption of his nature: and that wee may conceiue how, know, that one may be a bondman, either by ſelling himſelfe into captiuity and willingly obeying a Tyrant, or by being brought into captiuity againſt his will: as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſold into captiuity by his brethren. And this was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe here, in reſpect of ſin, he was a bondman vnder ſinne vnwillingly; he ſold not himſelfe, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, to worke wickedneſſe: but hee was held vnwillingly vnder the power of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and by that he was drawne to many things he allowed not, as he expounds himſelfe in the Verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: and that is his meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>hee was ſold vnder ſinne.</hi> Thus then conceiue wee his meaning in the wordes of this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Both you, and I, euen all of vs know this to be a truth, wee well vnderſtand it, that the morall Law of God is, in

               <p>We are here firſt to conſider the Epithite and Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the morall Law of God, that it is ſpirituall, and the point hence is that which is intended by this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite, namely this,</p>
               <p>That the morall Law of God is in the nature of it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, Angelicall, and diuine, <label type="milestone">

               <p>In the next place obſerue wee, that the Apoſtle doth not barely affirme this of the Law of God, that it is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; but he affirmes it as a knowne thing, a thing wel knowne to himſelfe and other true beleeuers.

The point hence is this,</p>
               <p>That true beleeuers, ſuch as are truly inlightened, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> they
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:422:151"/> know the ſpirituall nature of the Law of God,
<note place="margin">True belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſee and diſcerne the ſpirituall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole Word of God.</note> they reſt not in the letter of the Law, but they ſee and diſcerne the ſpirituality of it, and they are well acquainted with it, yea ſuch as are truly inlightened, they know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and they ſee and diſcerne the ſpirituall nature of the whole Word of God, they are acquainted with the Spirit and Life of the whole Word of God, both of the Law and of the Goſpell: <hi>The Word of God dwels in them,</hi> as it is <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.16. and they know not only the outward face of the Word of God, but they are acquainted with the inward purpoſe and meaning of it, and the nature of it, as they know the nature, and diſpoſition, and very purpoſe of the heart of one that dwels with them, and with whom they do conuerſe familiarly and are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.9. that he prayed for the Coloſſians, that <hi>they might be fulfilled with knowledge of the will of God, in all wiſedome and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vnderſtanding,</hi> that they might come to the wiſe and ſpirituall vnderſtanding of the Will of God reuealed in his Word.

And therefore they reſt not in the letter of the

               <p>Come we now to ſtand more particularly on that the Apoſtle here affirmes of himſelfe; <hi>that he was carnall, ſold vnder ſinne.</hi> And firſt, hee ſaith, <hi>that hee was carnall:</hi> namely, as we ſhewed, he was not ſimply and meerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as vnregenerate perſons be but he was carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiuely, and in ſome reſpects, as, namely, in reſpect of the perfect integrity, vprightneſſe, and ſpirituall nature of the Law of God, and in reſpect of perfect regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee was euen carnall, earthly and ſenſuall.

Why? Surely, all theſe, and the like, compare not themſelues with the holy &amp; pure Law of God, they compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues either with themſelues, or with others amongſt men, and they neuer examine themſelues by the holy and pure Law of God: and that indeed is the ground of their carnall ſelfe-loue, and ſelfe-liking.

               <p>Hence wee may eaſily gather proofe and confirmation of this Truth, that the beſt, and the moſt holy, and moſt regenerate that are in the world, are in ſome thraldome and bondage to their owne inbred corruption, &amp; though they doe not willingly yeeld to it, yet they are ſomtimes by the ſtrength of it ouer-carryed &amp; ouer-maſtered, and made to yeeld to the euill motions and luſts of it, and it doth ſometimes exerciſe a kinde of power ouer them: and the reaſons of it are theſe:</p>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:422:158"/> moues the minde and will after they be regenerate: for there is not onely a preuenting grace, but a ſubſequent grace needfull to the regenerate. Now the Lord ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is pleaſed to withdraw that following grace from them; and thereupon it is, that they are ſometimes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed, and made to yeeld to the euill motions and luſts of their owne hearts.</p>
               <p>Againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> grace and ſanctification are not alwayes in the like exerciſe: grace in Gods children is ſometimes weake and faint, and lyes hid, and as it were dead, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the exerciſe of it: and hereupon alſo it is, that they are ſometimes ouer-carryed, and made to yeeld to the euill motions and luſts of their owne hearts.

               <p>Yet this muſt not ſo be vnderſtood, that the Apoſtle was compelled to euill, but that he confented not to it with his whole will, he being now regenerate; as he was regenerate, he hated euill, and the euill he did, he did it with a lothing. Thus then briefly conceiue wee the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles meaning in this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>

               </p>

               <p>The Papiſts from theſe words of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">A Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit confuted.</note> 
                  <hi>I allow not that which I doe,</hi> conclude, that ſudden inuoluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, motions to euill, that ariſe from the fleſh and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts of the ſoule (as they call them) and gaine not the conſent of will, are no ſinnes. This is but a fancy. I ſhewed heretofore the weakneſſe of this conceit, Verſe 7. and made knowne, that concupiſcence, and the very firſt motions to euill, that ariſe from the corruption of nature, though they gaine not conſent of will, and though they be repelled and reiected, yet they are ſinnes forbidden in the tenth Commandement: and this very Text confuses this conceit: for the Apoſtle ſaith not onely thus, that <hi>he did not allow that which he did, but he hated it,</hi> it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and hatefull to him as hee was regenerate; and doubtleſſe it was odious and hatefull to him, becauſe it was euill and ſinfull, yea, euil and ſinful in it ſelfe, though he had neuer done it, and his doing of it vnwillingly, did not take away the nature of it, and make it ceaſe to bee euill: no, no; it was euill in it ſelfe, and ſo, odious and hatefull to the Apoſtle. I paſſe from that Popiſh conceit and fancy.</p>
               <p>Come wee to the confirmation of this Propoſition, that the Apoſtle did not allow the euill that hee did, in theſe words, <hi>for what I would, that I doe not: but what I hate, that doe I.</hi> And in that the Apoſtle confirmes it, that hee did not allow the euill he did, becauſe his will was to doe good, which he did not, and the euill hee did, was hatefull to him: Hence we might ſtand to ſhew,</p>
               <p>That men may know they allow not the euill they doe, when they would doe good, and they doe it not, and they allow not the euill they doe, they are hindred from doing good vnwillingly, and the euill they doe, is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them: but of that we haue partly ſpoken before, and therefore I paſſe by it.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:422:165"/>
               <p>Now from theſe wordes of the Apoſtle <hi>(What I would, that doe I not: but what I would not, that doe I:</hi> wee may gather this concluſion,</p>
               <p>That true beleeuers, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> and ſuch as are truely regenerate, are not only hindred from doing good vnwillingly,
<note place="margin">True belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſomtimes doe that euill that is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them.</note> but they doe the euill they hate, they are ſometimes drawne by the ſtrength of their owne corruption ſtill in part abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them, to doe that euill that is hatefull to them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that euill they doe in part lothe and abhor, they are ſometimes ouer-carryed to the doing of it. The Apoſtle here affirmes thus much of himſelfe; and this may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exemplified, and made cleere by the example of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other holy ſeruants of God. We reade that
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9.</note> NOAH <hi>was a iuſt and vpright man, and he walked with God.</hi> And the holy Ghoſt giues this teſtimony of him,
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.</note> that <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued with reuerence, prepared the Arke to the ſauing of his houſhold. He was a man truly fearing God,</hi> and a deare child of God, and doubtleſſe, he hated all manner of ſins, and eſpecially foule and groſſe ſins. And yet wee reade,
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.21.</note> that for want of watchfulnes, this holy man of God was ouertaken with a foule ſin, euen with the ſin of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Likewiſe we reade of <hi>Lot,</hi> that <hi>he was a iuſt man,</hi> a deare child of God: yea, the Apoſtle witneſſeth of him,
<note n="d" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8.</note> that <hi>he being iuſt, was vexed with the filthy and vncleane conuerſation of the Sodomites,</hi> and being righteous, and dwelling among them, in ſeeing and hearing, vexed his righteous ſoule from day to day with their vnlawfull deeds. So that without queſtion, his ſoule hated the ſin of vncleanneſſe: &amp; yet we reade
<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.33, 35</note> the latter end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was ouertaken with that ſinne that was hatefull to him, euen with the ſinne of vncleanneſſe, and that with his owne daughters. And to theſe we might adde many other examples of the deare Saints and Seruants of God, that haue beene ſometimes ouer-carryed by the ſtrength of their owne corruption, to doe the euill that was hatefull to them, and which they did in part lothe and abhor. But
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:422:165"/> here haply the queſtion will be moued, and I hold it needfull to anſwere it.</p>
               <p>How far one that is truly regenerate, &amp; a child of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> may yeeld to the luſt of his owne heart, and be drawne by the ſtrength of his owne corruption to doe euill, euen to doe euill, he hating euill, &amp; he lothing and abhorring it in ſome part, as hee is regenerate? For anſwere to this, we muſt know there be certayne degrees of yeelding to the euill luſts of the heart; certayne degrees, I ſay, there be, by which men yeeld to the luſts of their owne hearts, and are ouer-carryed by them to the doing of euill. There is a delight in them, conſent to them, and there's the act, and perſeuerance in the act. Now delight in euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or motions to euill that ariſe in the heart, may be found in a child of God, and in one that is truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; he may be pleaſed, and hee may be delighted with the euill motions of his heart; but conſent to them is not vſually and ordinarily found in a child of God; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is: and if at any time a child of God doe conſent to the luſts of his owne heart, it is but in part, and againſt his purpoſe, becauſe he is ouer-carryed by the ſtrength of them; and againe, the act or execution of luſt is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily found in a child of God: if at any time hee doe act and execute the luſt of his heart, and doe fall, he may ſay as the Apoſtle doth in this place, <hi>I doe that I hate:</hi> but for perſeuerance in the act of euill, and holding on in a courſe in doing euill with pleaſure, that cannot befall a child of God: for he hath the ſeed of grace in him, and that ſtirs him vp to recouer himſelfe by new repentance. Againe, we muſt know that a child of God, and one that is truly regenerate, may be drawne by the ſtrength of his owne corruption to doe euill, yea, ſome foule and groſſe particular euill, not generally to do euill, but ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular euil, being ſuddenly ſurpriſed by violence of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the ſtrength of his owne corruption. This was the caſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> in thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular foule ſins they fell into.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:422:166"/>
               <p>Thus then I briefly anſwere to the queſtion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> That a child of God, and one that is truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, may ſo farre yeeld to the luſts of his owne heart, as hee may delight in them, yea, hee may conſent to them, though not ordinarily, nor wholly, but at ſome times, and then only in part: and he may ſometimes, not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, but ſomtimes, he may proceed to the act and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of luſt; yet ſo, as he may truly ſay, hee hates the euill he doth, yea, ſometimes being on a ſudden ſurpriſed by violence of temptation, and the ſtrength of his owne corruption, he may fall into ſome foule and groſſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular euill and ſinne; but to perſeuer in the act of euill, and to hold on a courſe in doing euill with pleaſure, that is neuer found in any child of God and one that is truely regenerate. And thus wee ſee this truth confirmed and cleered, that true beleeuers and ſuch as are truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, are ſometimes drawne by the ſtrength of their owne corruption, ſtill in part abiding in them, to doe that euill that is hatefull to them, euen that euill they in part lothe and abhorre, they are ſometimes ouer-carryed to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>

But I ſpeake this for thy comfort, when notwithſtanding thy watchfulneſſe, and notwithſtanding thy care to keepe thy ſelfe from ſinne, thou art ſometimes ouer-carryed to the doing of that euill that is hatefull vnto thee, and which thou doſt in ſome part lothe and abhorre, thou art not then to be vtterly deiected and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt downe.</p>

               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Hee willed good, and hee hated euill,</hi> we made this a note of his regeneration, that therefore he was certainly regenerate; this being proper to the regenerate, and neuer found in any but ſuch as are truly regenerate. But againſt this lyes an obiection: I will briefly propound and anſwere it.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:422:167"/>
               <p>Thus ſome obiect againſt it; ſay they, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> Euen the vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate will that which is good: for all men naturally deſire that that is good and right: Reaſon inclines to good. The Heathen Philoſopher could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and vnregenerate perſons in ſome ſort hate euill. <hi>Iudas</hi> cryed out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.4. <hi>I haue ſinned, and haue done euill, betraying the innocent bloud.</hi> And therefore this is not proper to the regenerate, to wil good, and to hate euill.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere thus; There is a threefold good: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> firſt, there is a naturall good, which all things deſire; and this is not the obiect of reaſon or of the will, but of the naturall appetite, which in it ſelfe makes men neither good nor bad.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a moral good, which howſoeuer the light of reaſon being in the full ſtrength of it, may yeeld to, in them that be vnregenerate, and may make them ſometimes to doe it; yet as that good comes from them, and as it is done by them, it is not truly good, nay, it is ſinne to them, being not done in obedience to Gods Commandement, and of Faith, and to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is ſpirituall good, which is heauenly and ſpirituall, which is of the Spirit and of Faith: now that good vnregenerate perſons cannot wil, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould will it; for they haue no knowledge nor vnderſtanding of it: and this is that good, the Apoſtle here ſaid he willed, and would haue done.</p>
               <p>Againe, vnregenerate perſons in ſome ſort hate euill. It is true: but how? Surely, onely for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in ſome other ſiniſter and by-reſpect, and not becauſe it is euill, and ſinfull, and diſpleaſing to God, and to the diſhonour of God. No, no: they hate not euill in any ſuch reſpect: and ſo it remaines a true note of the Apoſtles regeneration, that hee willed good, and hated euill: and it is a true note to others,
<note place="margin">A true note of regeneration.</note> that they are alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, if they finde in themſelues that they will that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:422:168"/> which is ſpiritually good, euen that good which is of the Spirit and of faith, and that they hate euill, not in a ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and by-reſpect, but becauſe it is euill, and diſpleaſing to God, and is to the diſhonour of God: and, if they were put to their choyce, they would rather dye the moſt cruell death, then wittingly and willingly doe euill, and ſinne againſt God. That is a true note of regeneration.</p>

The ſumme and ſubſtance of his firſt inference and concluſion laid before vs in this Verſe, is this, that there was in ſome ſort a good harmony, and a conſent betweene Gods Law and his heart, being now renued by grace, in that he hated and abhorred the euill that was done by him, becauſe it was euill and ſinful, and contrary to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>And thus he concludes, If I doe what I would not, I conſent to the Law of God that it is good. But the firſt of theſe is true: therefore the ſecond. Now the ground of this inference is this generall,</p>
               <p>That whoſoeuer he be, that wils not the euill he doth, but diſallowes and hates it, and that out of a loue, and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:422:170"/> liking, and reſpect to the Law of God, and a conſent to that, he ſeeing that euill which he doth, to be contrary to the Law of God, doubtleſſe hee approues of the Law of God to be good, and to be the perfect rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus we haue the Apoſtles firſt inference and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the ground of it. Now the words of this Verſe need not long to be ſtood on, touching the ſenſe and meaning of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If I doe then that which I would not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpretation</note> Theſe words we had in effect before: and the meaning of them is briefly this: <hi>If I act and doe inwardly in my mind, my will and my affections, and outwardly in my wordes and actions, that euill that I in part would not doe, as I am regenerate, becauſe it is euill, and againſt the Law of God, then I conſent to the Law, that it is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Conſent)</hi> The word in the Originall properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>to confeſſe, to witneſſe with a thing, or to ſpeake with a thing to which it is applyed.</hi> As here, being applyed to the Law of God, the meaning is, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>I confeſſe the goodneſſe of the Law of God, I ſubſcribe to it, I agree to it, I beare witneſſe with it to be good, I conſent, or I aſſent in my mind and iudgement, and in mine heart I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Law of God to be good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the word <hi>(Law)</hi> as before, wee are to vnderſtand the morall Law of God. <hi>(That it is good)</hi> that is, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee expounded the word, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. that it requires and commands only ſuch things as be good, and forbids the contrary all manner of euill, and ſhewes the good way in which men are to walke to life euerlaſting. Thus then conceiue wee the meaning of the Apoſtle in the wordes of this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If I then act and doe inwardly in my mind, will and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and outwardly in my wordes and actions that euill, that I in part would not doe, as I am regenerate, and as my heart is renued by grace, and that, becauſe it is euill, and againſt the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:422:171"/> Law of God. Surely then, I agree to the morall Law of God, and I beare witneſſe with it to be good, I conſent, or I aſſent to the goodneſſe of the Law of God, in my mind and iudgement, and in mine heart renued by grace, I approue the Law of God to be ſuch a Law, as requires and commands only good things, and forbids the contrary, euen all manner of euill, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good way in which men are to walke to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, hence obſerue we the Apoſtles inference, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I act and doe the euill I would not,</hi> the euill that in ſome ſort is againſt my mind, my will, and my purpoſe, then I conſent to the Law, that it is good; I then aſſent to the goodneſſe of the Law of God, I approue the Law of God to be ſuch a Law, as requires and commands only good things, and forbids the contrary. Hence note we briefly thus much,</p>
               <p>That when men doe euill againſt their purpoſe and will, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label>
                  <note place="margin">It is an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the goodneſſe of Gods Law, when men doe euill, and they would not doe it.</note> they doe euill, and they would not doe it, they haue in them a full purpoſe and reſolution, not to ſinne againſt God in any thing wittingly and willingly, and yet they ſinne againſt that purpoſe, then they conſent to the Law of God, then they yeeld to the Word of God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good duties, that it is good, that plainely proues it, and thereupon they may certainly conclude, that they in their mindes aſſent to the good Law of God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of it in their hearts to be good; it is a plaine eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of conſent to the goodneſſe of the Law of God, when men doe euill, and they would not doe it, but they would willingly be freed from doing of euill, and from breaking of the holy Lawes and Commandements of GOD.</p>
               <p>Thus our Apoſtle here concludes directly, <hi>If I doe that euill which I would not, I conſent to the Law, that it is good.</hi> This I note in a word, to teach euery one of vs to try our ſelues, touching our conſent to the Word of God.

And for Apoſtataes, it is true indeede; they taſte, and as it were ſippe of the ſweetneſſe of the Word of God, they touch it, as it were with the tip of their tongues, but they neuer ſend it downe into their hearts, they digeſt it not, it is not conuerted and turned as

               <p>Inſtance might be giuen in many other examples, Gods children are ready to doe the will of God made knowne to them.

And againe, no ſooner ſaith the Lord, Forbeare this, or, Auoid that: but the heart of a child of God anſwers, I will forbeare it, and I will auoid it. And that ſtrongly confirmes the truth of the point in hand, that there is a good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene the hearts of Gods children, and the good Law of God: the reaſon and ground of it is this:</p>

Surely then, this points out a plaine difference betweene Gods children, and others that are either openly wicked or hypocrites, for it is farre otherwiſe with them: the vngodly man and the hypocrite may indeed in his mind and iudgement aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the good Law of God, he may, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced in

<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> It is no longer I, as I am now renued by grace, and in the ſtate of regeneration, it is not any longer I, as I am regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and ſo farre forth as I am regenerate that now doe it: <hi>(doe it)</hi> that is, that euill that I would not, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and that ſinne that I hate <hi>(but the ſinne that dwelleth in me,</hi> that doeth it.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Sinne)</hi> is here taken as before, for ſinful corruption, the corruption of nature, or inborne finne <hi>(that dwelleth in me.)</hi> This Phraſe is <hi>Metaphoricall,</hi> it is borrowed and taken from <hi>Houſholders,</hi> from ſuch as haue their certayne abode and reſidence in a place or houſe, and doe there buſie themſelues, and exerciſe their power and authority, and it ſignifieth the true and powerfull preſence of ſinne, and the ſtrong working of it, as the Spirit of God is ſaid to dwell in true Beleeuers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. ſignifying the true powerfull and working preſence of the Spirit in them: and ſo Satan with ſeuen other ſpirits is ſaid to returne to the houſe whence hee came, and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:422:177"/> to enter in, and to dwell there, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. that is, more powerfully and more ſtrongly to take poſſeſſion of that man. And ſo the Apoſtles meaning, in ſaying, <hi>ſinne that dwelleth in me,</hi> is this, The ſin that is ſtill remayning and abiding in me, and hath a powerfull and a working pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in mee, euen forcibly croſſing the motions of the Spirit in my heart, and haling and pulling me to euill and ſinne. Thus then briefly conceiue we the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And againe if I doe that euill, which I would not, and that euill that I hate, then it is no longer I, as I am regenerate, and ſo farre forth as I am regenerate, that doe that euill, but the ſinfull corruption, the corruption of nature, that is ſtill remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and abiding in me in part, and hath a powerfull and working preſence in me, euen forcibly croſſing the motions of the Spirit in my heart, and haling and pulling me to euill, that is it that doth the euill that is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here againe obſerue we the Apoſtles inference, marke his concluſion here brought in on his former antecedent, thus he concludes: If (ſaith hee) I doe the euill which I would not doe, If I do that euill that is againſt my mind, my will, my purpoſe and reſolution, as I am now rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, then it is not I that doe it, but it is the ſinne that dwells in me that doth it, that is his inference. Hence note we further thus much,</p>
               <p>That when men doe euill, <label type="milestone">

If the thing be rightly vnderſtood, and not miſconceiued, and if a man or woman be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, and that truely, <hi>I doe the euill I would not doe,</hi> then hee or ſhee may alſo conclude with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:422:177"/> and truly ſay, <hi>It is not I that doe it,</hi> but the inbred corruption that ſtill in part abides in me, that doth it: and to this agrees that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9.</note> It is a plaine Text to this purpoſe: <hi>Whoſoeuer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is borne of God, ſinneth not: for his ſeede remaineth in him, neyther can hee ſinne, becauſe hee is borne of God.

                  <hi>we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is then his meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>Whoſoeuer is borne of God, ſinneth not?</hi> Surely this: When they that are truely regenerate and borne anew of God, ſinne, it is againſt their mind, and againſt their purpoſe, they would not ſo ſinne; and ſo indeede it is as if they ſinned not: and it may be truely affirmed of them, being rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, it is not they that ſinne, but the corruption of nature that ſtill in part abides in them: and the reaſon of this may eaſily be rendred; this it is:</p>
               <p>That part in man that is truely regenerate, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.3, 6, 7, 11, 16, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 30, 32.</note> in many Verſes: and ſo that part that is truly regenerate not ſinning, and they taking their denomination from that part, it may be truly ſaid, that they that are borne of God, and truly regenerate, ſinne not: and wee may hold this as a certayne truth, when men doe euill, and they would not doe it, the euill they doe, is againſt their mind and purpoſe, that then it may be truly ſaid, being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood, it is not they that ſinne and doe euill, but
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:422:178"/> it is the inbred corruption, that ſtill in part abides in them, that doth it. Now then to make vſe of this, firſt,</p>
               <p>This Truth meets with that fond conceit of ſome, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> who though they giue themſelues ouer to all carnall luſts of their owne hearts,
<note place="margin">The fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Familiſts and others, met withall.</note> yet fooliſhly thus thinke to excuſe themſelues, that it is ſinne that doth euill, and not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as thoſe fooliſh, phanaticall and fantaſtike ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the Familiſts, of all erring ſpirits the moſt groſſe, they make no conſcience of Swearing, of Lying and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocating, of Sabbath-breaking, of Drunkenneſſe, of Whoredome and filthineſſe, they make no bones of any foule ſinne, and yet they thinke to excuſe themſelues by this, that (forſooth) it is the fleſh that ſinneth, and not they, and they thinke ſo to ſhift off the matter, by laying the burden on the fleſh: and ſo common Drunkards, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Adulterers, common Swearers, and the like, they thinke to excuſe and cloke their wicked and vicious life with this, that they do not the euill, but ſinne that dwels in them. Now, ſuch perſons, both Familiſts and others, doe moſt wickedly abuſe this holy ſentence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>It is no more I that doe euill, but ſinne that dwels in mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine deliuered ſhewes plainly, that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence cannot agree to ſuch perſons: for why? they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay and ſpeake the truth, that they doe euill, and they would not doe it, and the euill they doe is againſt their mind and purpoſe, and that they hate the euill they doe. No, no: there is no ſuch matter in them, they doe euill wittingly and willingly, yea, they ruſh into ſinne, <hi>as the barbed horſe ruſheth into the battell. Ierem.</hi> 8.6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot thus plead excuſe, and thus ſhift off the matter, that it is not they that doe euill, but ſinne that dwels in them. If they ſo doe, they abuſe this holy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and they miſapply it, and it will not ſerue their turne. If thou wouldſt find comfort in this holy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and apply it to thy ſelfe with comfort, thou muſt
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:422:178"/> be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>The euill I doe, I would not doe,</hi> I allow it not, nay, I hate it: and then indeed thou maiſt ſay with comfort, <hi>It is not I that doe euill, but the ſin that dwels in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this indeed is a ſweet comfort to Gods children, their owne hearts witneſſing with them, that the euill they doe, they would not doe it: they may then ſay, It is not they that doe it, but ſinne that dwels in them, and the euill done by them may in ſome ſort bee ſaid not to bee their ſinne, if it be rightly vnderſtood: and ſo, to driue the point to a ſecond vſe,</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that euill done by the regenerate, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> in ſome ſort is not their ſinne, they being vnwilling to doe it? Surely,
<note place="margin">Comfort for ſuch as are tempted to ſtrange euils.</note> then much leſſe is the euill to which they only are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to which they yeeld not, much leſſe is that their ſinne. Here is then comfort for ſuch as are tempted to ſtrange euils, and whom Satan doth vexe with fearefull ſuggeſtions; as to blaſpheme God, to deny God, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way to thinke amiſſe of God: doe they thereupon thinke amiſſe of themſelues? doe they thereupon hold themſelues moſt vile wretches? doe they beate backe the temptation? Surely, then it is not their ſinne: euen the beſt may be tempted to moſt horrible ſinnes. What more fearefull, then to worſhip the Deuill in perſon? Yet to this ſinne was Chriſt himſelfe tempted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.9.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth</hi> 4.9.</note> Therefore bee not thou diſcouraged, though thou bee tempted to moſt groſſe and odious ſinnes, if thou yeeld not vnto them.</p>
               <p>Obſerue we further, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is no more I that doe it, but the ſinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> Hee ſaith not barely, It is not I that doe it, but, It is no more I, I find now a difference in my ſelfe, from that it was wont to be with me in doing euill, It was heretofore I that did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but now it is not I that doe it, but the ſinne that dwelleth in me.</p>
               <p>Hence we may gather a manifeſt difference betweene <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label>

<note place="margin">Difference betweene Gods children and the vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, in doing euill.</note> and ſuch as be vnregenerate, in doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: Gods children, they ſinne no more, it is no more they that ſinne, that is, they ſinne not wholly with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will, becauſe they haue in them not only fleſh, but Spirit; not only corruption but grace alſo: but vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſons, they ſinne wholly with full conſent of will, and it is they that doe the ſinne, and the euill that is done by them, they doe it indeed, they powre out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſinne. <hi>Iude Epiſt. verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>They walke after the luſts of their owne hearts,</hi> becauſe they are wholly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fleſh and corruption. And this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the regenerate and vnregenerate in ſinning, wee find put downe in many places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>If then for the vſe of it, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">The beſt of Gods children haue ſinne ſtill dwelling in them, as a bold Inmate.</note> from the in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſinne.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe, our Apoſtle fals on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree of the Spirituall combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the fleſh and the Spirit, in them that be truly regenerate, ſtill inſiſting in his owne example; and hauing ſhewed before, that by ſinne hee was brought to doe the euill he would not, that being the firſt degree of the ſpirituall conflict; Here he comes to the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, and ſhewes that he by ſinne was hindred from doing the good which he would. And this is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Verſe 18. and proued firſt by the contrary effects, Verſe 19. and then by the contrary cauſes, the Law mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to good, and he thereunto conſenting, and ſin hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him, Verſe 20, 21. that is the generall matter of the 18, 19, 20, and 21, Verſes.</p>
               <p>Now touching the dependance of the 18. Verſe on foregoing matter, thus it is, the Apoſtle hauing ſaid in the Verſe before, that find welt in him, in the firſt wordes of the 18. Verſe, he confirmes that by his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge, that he knew it, and found it to be ſo in himſelfe, and hee affirmes on his owne knowledge, that in him there was no good thing dwelling: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinne dwelling in him (expounding his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leſt he ſhould be miſtaken, in ſaying, that <hi>in him dwelt no good thing,</hi> namely thus, that hee meant in his fleſh:) for, ſaith he, <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing,</hi> and then hee further explaines and confirmes the Propoſition, that in him, that is, in his fleſh dwelt no good thing, by an Argument from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſinne in himſelfe, namely, the doing of good hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:422:182"/> that he could not performe it; he ſaith he was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in doing good, ſo as <hi>he found no meanes to performe it;</hi> and he further amplifies that effect, by his will to good, as he was now regenerate, that indeed he willed good, as he was now in the ſtate of regeneration, but he found no power in himſelfe to performe it: for, ſaith hee, <hi>to will is preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good:</hi> and that could be from no other thing, but from ſinne dwelling in him.</p>
               <p>We haue then in this Verſe laid before vs, firſt, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, wherin the Apoſtle affirmes on his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>there was no good thing dwelling in him,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his fleſh. And ſecondly, a confirmation of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, from the effect of ſinne dwelling in him, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him in doing of good, amplified by his wil to good, as he was now regenerate: That howſoeuer there was in him, as he was now regenerate, a will to good, yet hee found no meanes to performe it. Of theſe in order, and firſt, of the Apoſtles Propoſition. <hi>For I know, that in me, that is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I know.</hi> I know, ſaith the Apoſtle, that is,
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> I am priuy to it, and well acquainted with it, and I frankly and freely confeſſe and acknowledge it, as a thing well and certainly knowne to mee ſo to be, <hi>(that in mee)</hi> this the Apoſtle expounds himſelfe in the wordes following, that is, in my fleſh. Now the word <hi>Fleſh,</hi> is not here to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the externall part of man, the fleſhy lumpe of the body, nor as ſometimes it is in Scripture, for the humane nature, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh:</hi> but for the corruption of nature, or for the part vnregenerate: and that thorowout, in all the powers and faculties of the ſoule, it ſignifies not only, as the Papiſts teach, ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the corruption of the inferiour parts of the ſoule, but the corruption alſo of the mind, vnderſtanding, and will: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The wiſedome of the fleſh is enmity againſt God:</hi> which muſt needs be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:422:183"/> of the very beſt parts of the ſoule, wherein wiſedome is ſeated: and <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.18. the Apoſtle ſpeakes plainly, and giues fleſhlineſſe to the mind raſhly puft vp with his fleſhly mind, with his carnall corruption, and vnregenerate mind. <hi>(Dwelleth)</hi> that is, as before wee ſhewed, abideth, and hath a powerfull and working pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence <hi>(no good thing.)</hi> By <hi>Good</hi> in this place, we are not to vnderſtand naturall good, which is the obiect of the naturall appetite, nor yet morall good, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apprehended of naturall reaſon, being in full force and ſtrength; but ſpirituall good, euen that which is ſpiritually holy and good, and is pleaſing to God, that good is here meant. Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe words. <hi>For I know, that in me, that is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing:</hi> As if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I am priuy to it, I am well acquainted with it, and I freely and frankly acknowledge it ſo to be, that in me, that is, in my corrupt nature, and ſo farre forth as I am vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, there is nothing that is truly &amp; ſpiritually good and holy, nothing that is pleaſing to God, remayning and abiding; there is no ſuch thing hath any reſidence or abode, or hath any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and working preſence in any power or faculty of my ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are here to marke, that the Apoſtle doth not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme this of himſelfe, that in him, that is, in his fleſh there was no good thing dwelling: but he affirmes it on his owne knowledge, he ſaith, I know it, I am priuy to it, I am well acquainted with it, and I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. Hence two things are offered to vs; I will ſpeake of them in order, as firſt this, hence we are giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</p>
               <p>That Gods children, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> and as many as are truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<note place="margin">Gods children well diſcerne that there is no good thing in themſelues as of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</note> they are priuy to their owne corruption, ſtill in part abiding in them, they are well acquainted with it, that in their corrupt and vnregenerate nature, ſo farre forth as they are vnregenerate, there is no goodneſſe, they are not
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:422:183"/> ignorant of it, but they know it well, and they ſee it, and well diſcerne it, that there is no good thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as of themſelues, but that all the goodneſſe they haue in them, is of grace, and meerely of grace, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes plainly, ſpeaking of himſelfe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</note> ſaith he, <hi>By the grace of God, I am that I am.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I haue no goodneſſe in me as of my ſelfe, but all the goodneſſe I haue in mee, is meerely of grace: and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. he ſaith, We are not ſufficient,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>We are not able of our ſelues to think any thing that is truly good as of our ſelues, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> it is meerely of God, and of his grace, that we are able to thinke a good thought, of our ſelues, we cannot thinke any thing that is truly good. This the Apoſtle was priuy to, and this hee was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall. And ſo indeed are all Gods children, and ſuch as are truly regenerate, they are priuy to it, they are well acquainted with it, they ſee it, and well diſcerne it, that there is no good thing in themſelues, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and that in their vnregenerate part, there is no good thing dwelling: And the reaſon of it is this,</p>
               <p>Gods children, and ſuch as are truely regenerate, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> they haue in them the Spirit of grace, and the Spirit of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, euen that Spirit that enables them to ſpie out and diſcerne the hidden corruption of their hearts, euen the relikes of it ſtill abiding in them, and <hi>their eyes are anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with eye-ſalue,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.18. their eyes are opened, and they are truely inlighted, and they are made able to ſee and diſcerne what is in them, &amp; ſo they come to be priuy to it, and to be well acquainted with it, that there is no good thing in themſelues, as of themſelues. Now then for the vſe of this, firſt,</p>
               <p>It diſcouers whence it is that moſt men in the world are highly conceited of themſelues, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>
                  <note place="margin">Whence is it, that moſt men are highly conceited of themſelues.</note> and thinke that there is ſome goodneſſe in them by nature; yea, in this point men by nature are Popiſh; as the Papiſts doe, ſo do they, they magnifie nature, and they are conceited of their pure
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:422:184"/> naturals, and they thinke if they liue a ciuill honeſt life, they are not to be taxed for any thing, they are in an happy caſe, yea, poore blind ignorant ſoules ſtick not to ſtand on their good hearts, and on their good meaning, and good dealing, and to thinke they ſhall be ſaued for theſe things. Now whence is this? Surely, from hence; they are not regenerate, they haue not the Spirit of grace and of diſcerning, their eyes are not anoynted with the eye-ſalue of the Spirit, and ſo they thinke as the Church of Laodicea did, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.17. that <hi>they are rich, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with goods, and haue need of nothing, and know not that they are wretched, and miſerable, and blind, and poore, and naked;</hi> their eyes are not opened as the eyes of Gods children be, to ſee and diſcerne that there is no good thing in them, as of themſelues, and it is a plaine eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt men whoſoeuer they be, that thinke they haue ſome goodneſſe in them, of themſelues, and that thinke they are ſo purged from the corruption of ſinne, as that they haue no more remayning in them, that they know not themſelues, and as one ſaith well, they are <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni homines,</hi> they are new and ſtrange men indeed, that is, they are notable hypocrites.</p>
               <p>Againe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> is it ſo, that Gods children, and as many as be truely regenerate,
<note place="margin">A note of a child of God, and one truely regenerate.</note> are priuie to it, and well acquainted with it, that there is no good thing in themſelues, as of themſelues? doe they ſee it, and doe they well diſcerne it? Then doe not thou fancy to thy ſelfe, that thou art a a childe of God, vnleſſe thou finde it thus with thee, that thou ſeeſt and diſcerneſt the hidden corruption of thine owne heart, and that thou art well acquainted with it, that there is no good thing in thee as of thy ſelfe. Euery one of yeeres and diſcretion, can take notice of foule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſins; but few ſee &amp; diſcerne it, and few are throughly acquainted with it, that there is no good thing dwelling in them; and if thou once come to ſee it, and well to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it, and complaine of it, that there is no goodnes in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:422:184"/> thee, and if thou come to be thorowly acquainted with thine owne blindneſſe of mind, deadneſſe of heart, and the like, and ſee theſe things in thy ſelfe with griefe, and complayne of them, that is a good complaint, it ſeales vp comfort vnto thee, it is a plaine euidence that thou art a child of God: for thus indeed it is with Gods children, and with as many as are truely regenerate. Now the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing offered from hence, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I know that in me (that is) in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing,</hi> I know it, I am priuie to it, and I freely acknowledge it, is this,</p>
               <p>That Gods children are not onely priuie to it, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> that there is no good thing in them, as of themſelues,
<note place="margin">Gods children are ready freely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their owne weakneſſe and their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</note> but they are ready to acknowledge it on any iuſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble not the weakneſſe of their vnregenerate nature, but they are ready to acknowledge it freely and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, whenſoeuer it may make for the glory of God, and the good of others, yea, Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ready to ſhame themſelues in laying open their ſinfull infirmities, yea in charging on themſelues foule ſinnes, whereof they haue beene guilty, when it may be for Gods glory, or any way for the good of others.

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15.</note> 14, 15.</p>
               <p>This then for the vſe of it ſhewes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> that it is a wrong and an imputation falſly and vniuſtly caſt on Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they are conceited of their owne holineſſe, and that they thinke themſelues holy and pure. Alas, there is no ſuch matter: Gods children are priuy to that in themſelues, which the world ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not charge them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and they are ready to acknowledge it as occaſion is offered, and they doe moſt of all others abaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themſelues, and though <hi>they know nothing by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,</hi> in regard of any groſſe ſinne, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. yet they dare not ſtand on that,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</note> but ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themſelues, being priuy to it, that there is in them matter inough deſeruing condemnation.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:422:185"/>
               <p>In the next place obſerue we, that the Apoſtle affirmes this of himſelfe, that there was no good thing dwelling in him, as a proofe of that which he ſaid in the Verſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, that ſinne dwelt in him: he proues it by this, <hi>That there was in him, namely, in his fleſh, no good thing dwelling and abiding.</hi> And thus he reaſons, <hi>There is in me, that is, in my fleſh, no good thing dwelling;</hi> therefore ſinne dwels in me. This manner of reaſoning points out thus much to vs,</p>
               <p>That where there is no good thing dwelling, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> there ſin dwels.
<note place="margin">Such perſons as haue no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe nor ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in them, haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſinne and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abiding in all the powers and faculties of their ſoules.</note> In whomſoeuer there is no goodneſſe, no holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe abiding, in them ſinne and corruption hath certaine reſidence and abode: yea ſuch men as haue in them no holineſſe nor ſanctification at all in them, there is nothing but ſinne and corruption abiding, and that throughout in all the powers of their ſoules. Men and Women may pleaſe themſelues in a conceit of ſome goodnes in them, and thinke that they are of a better temper and better nature then others, and that they haue more goodneſſe in them then others: becauſe haply they are not troubled and annoyed with ſuch particular corruptions as others are; but indeed, vnleſſe they be renued by grace, and haue true holineſſe &amp; ſanctification in them, they doe but deceiue themſelues: that they are not troubled and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with thoſe particular corruptions that others are, is but from reſtrayning grace, the Lord moderating and brideling their corruption, that they breake not forth; indeed and truth they haue nothing but ſinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption abiding in them, in all the powers and faculties of their ſoules. For why? Euery man and woman in the world is either regenerate or vnregenerate; euery one is either in his naturall ſtate and condition, and beares the image of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and the image of Satan, or elſe is tranſlated &amp; ſet out of that ſtate, and is renued according to Gods Image, and in ſome meaſure beares the Image of God; there is no <hi>medium:</hi> no middle nor indifferent ſtate and condition betweene theſe two.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:422:185"/>
               <p>And hence it is, that we are often in the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to <hi>caſt off, or put off the old man, and to put on the new,</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24</note> 
                  <hi>Caſt off</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the old man, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> And <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.9, 10.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Lye not one to another, ſeeing that yee haue put off the old man with his workes, and haue put on the new which is renned in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi> Plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teaching vs, that there is no middle ſtate and condition betweene theſe two. A man or woman is certainly either regenerate or vnregenerate, and beares either the image of the old man with his workes, or the Image of God. And therefore ſuch men or women as haue no true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe nor ſanctification in them, there is nothing but ſin and corruption abiding in all the powers and faculties of their ſoules.</p>
               <p>And this I note, <label type="milestone">

Haſt thou in thee no true zeale to Gods glory, no true loue to God, to his Word and Ordinances, to his Children? Doſt thou find no new quality of grace and holineſſe wrought in thee? Deceiue not thy ſelfe, thy caſe is not good, thy harmeleſſe diſpoſition is only from the ouer-ruling hand of God, moderating and brideling thy corruption, and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:422:186"/> indeed there is yet nothing but ſinne and corruption abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all the powers &amp; faculties of thy ſoule, and as yet thou beareſt the image of <hi>Adam;</hi> Therefore reſt not in that, but if thou wouldſt haue ground of true comfort, neuer reſt till thou find that there is ſome new goodneſſe and holineſſe wrought in thee, that thou art truly inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, that thou haſt in thine heart a true loue of God, a true delight in good things; and that indeed will mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter true and ſound comfort to thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Now further, in that the Apoſtle here affirmes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>that in him, that is, in his fleſh,</hi> in his corrupt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerte nature, and ſo farre forth as he was vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>there was no good thing dwelling,</hi> he being a man truly regenerate, and endued with a great meaſure of grace, he giues vs to vnderſtand, how it is with the beſt and moſt regenerate: and the point hence is this,</p>

               <p>Whence it is cleere, that howſoeuer theſe holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God and his deare children, were men that had the Spirit of grace and ſanctification in a very ample and large meaſure, yet they found that there was no goodnes in them as they were vnregenerate, but rather much fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and much vncleanneſſe, polluting and defiling the beſt of their actions. And thus indeed it is with the beſt of Gods children, and the moſt regenerate that liue in the world, in their fleſh, and in that part of them that is vnregenerate, there is no good thing to be found; and the reaſon is plaine, namely this,</p>
               <p>Nature, in regard of the corruption of it, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>

               </p>
               <p>Now Gods children, ſo farre forth as they are ſtill in part fleſh and not regenerate, they are not altered and changed, nor wrought on by grace, but the fleſh that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes in them in part, ſtill continues fleſh, and it is ſtill corrupt and naught: and therfore hereupon we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that howſoeuer Gods children, and ſuch as are truly regenerate, haue many graces and good things in them, as they are regenerate and renued by grace, yet as they are ſtill in part fleſh, in their fleſh, and in that part of them that is yet vnregenerate, there is no good thing to be found.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> is it thus with Gods children and ſuch as are truly regenerate, that in their fleſh, and in their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part, there is no good thing to be found? What good thing then, I beſeech you, can there be found
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:422:187"/> in vnregenerate perſons,
<note place="margin">Vnregenerate perſons haue not ſo much goodneſſe in them, as to prepare themſelues to receiue grace and to merit of congruity.</note> and in ſuch as are yet in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall condition? Is it poſſible that they ſhould haue any thing that is truly good in them? No, no: it is altogether impoſſible, and it is erroneous and falſe which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts hold and teach, That men, before Regeneration, haue ſo much goodneſſe in them, as they are able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues to receiue grace, yea, to doe good works that may pleaſe God, and merit of congruity, as they ſpeake. This is a foule and groſſe error, if men that are truly regenerate haue no good thing in them, as they are yet fleſh, and ſo farre forth as they are vnregenerate, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſuch as be vnregenerate, cannot poſſibly haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is truely good in them, they being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fleſh, and nothing but fleſh, neither can they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing truely good and pleaſing to God. Things that are good they may doe, but as they are done by them, they are not good, nor pleaſing to God, much leſſe doe they merit any thing at the hands of God; for their fleſh and their corrupt nature is the ground of all that they doe; and ſo the things done by them, though good in themſelues, yet as they are done by them, they are ſinnes. Therefore we are to renounce it as an vntruth, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh error, that men, before Regeneration, are able to prepare themſelues to receiue grace, and to doe good workes pleaſing to God, and meriting of congruity.</p>
               <p>Againe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> is it ſo, that howſoeuer Gods children haue many good things in them,
<note place="margin">Gods children haue cauſe to be humbled for their beſt actions.</note> as they be regenerate, yet as they are ſtill in part fleſh, there is in that fleſh of theirs no good thing to be found. Surely then, Gods children muſt know they haue cauſe to be humbled for their beſt actions: for why? their fleſh will be meddling in their beſt workes, and the beſt things they doe, come in part from the fleſh: and ſo farre forth as any thing done by Gods children comes from the fleſh, it ſauours of the fleſh, and it is euill, and they haue cauſe to be humbled for it; yea, on the ground of doctrine now deliuered,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:422:187"/> Gods children muſt further learne to keepe their hearts and mindes exerciſed on good things, &amp; they muſt looke that they exerciſe that grace and that holineſſe that is in them: <q>for indeed, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                     </label> the heart and mind of man is euer ſtirring and working; and if grace be not kept on foote, and ſtirring, and in exerciſe, the fleſh will be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and working,</q> and there is no good thing in that, and that will certainly bring forth nothing but euill.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, no doubt, that Gods children are many times foyled and ouercome of temptation to ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they keepe not that grace that is in them, ſtirring, and working, and in exerciſe: for it is either through want of grace, or weakeneſſe of grace, or through want of the exerciſe of grace, that men fall into ſinne; for, if grace be not ſtirred vp and exerciſed, the heart that hath no good thing in it, of it ſelfe ioynes hands with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and betrayes men into his hands, and thruſts them on into temptation. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> caſe, and <hi>Iudahs</hi> caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. Oh then, learne, whoſoeues thou art, to keepe that grace that is in thee, ſtirring and in exerciſe, if thou wouldſt not be foyled and ouercome of temptation to ſinne; thy heart hath no good thing in it of it ſelfe; and if that grace that is in it, be not kept ſtirring, and working, and in exerciſe, it will deceiue thee, and thruſt thee on into temptation.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the ſecond generall thing laid before vs in this Verſe, the confirmation of the Apoſtles Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>That in him,</hi> namely, <hi>in his fleſh, dwelt no good thing,</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>For to will is preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle confirmes his Propoſition, that in him, that is, in his fleſh, no good thing dwelled, from the effect of ſin dwelling in him, which was the hindering of him in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good; as that it ſo hindred him in doing good, as hee found no meanes to performe it: which is amplified by his will to good, as he was regenerate, and howſoeuer
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:422:188"/> as hee was regenerate, hee willed good, yet hee found no meanes to performe that which is good. So much in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is compriſed in theſe wordes, <hi>For to will is preſent with mee, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For to will:</hi> the word <hi>(Will)</hi> here ſignifies not that power or faculty of the ſoule that is called Will. And againe, it ſignifies not an abſolute act or worke of willing,
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> to will abſolutely, nor to will indifferently, nor yet to will euill; but an act of willing good, to will that which is good, namely, to chooſe good, to purpoſe good, and to deſire to doe that which is good, as appeares plainly by that the Apoſtle ſubioynes, <hi>I find no meanes to performe that which is good.</hi> As if he had ſaid, To will good, to chooſe good, to purpoſe and to deſire the doing of good, is preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe that good. <hi>(Is preſent)</hi> The word <hi>Preſent</hi> ſignifies, is ready, &amp; is at hand, or is not to ſeeke. <hi>(With me)</hi> that is, with me <hi>Paul,</hi> as I am regenerate, and renued by grace: for the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of himſelfe with that limitation, that with him, as he was regenerate to will, <hi>Good was preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe,</hi> or as it is in the Originall, <hi>but to performe that which is good I find not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word here rendred <hi>(to performe)</hi> ſignifies to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, or to perfect; and by the word <hi>(Good)</hi> we are to vnderſtand that which is truely good. And ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles meaning is, to accompliſh the good I purpoſe and deſire to doe, or to perfect good things, euen things tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, as I would doe them, and without imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>(I find not)</hi> that is, I find not ſufficient ability and power, I find that I want ability and ſtrength to that purpoſe, my fleſh and corruption that ſtill remaynes in me hindring of mee. Some may ſay, It ſeemes then that <hi>Paul</hi> was not regenerate, in that he ſaith, he willed good, but was not able to performe it; for in the regenerate, God works both the will and the deed. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. ſaith
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:422:188"/> the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>It is God that workes in you both the will and thee deed, euen of his good pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, That it is true indeed that God works both the will and the deed in the regenerate, whenſoeuer they doe both will good, and performe good, it is God that works both; but hence it followes not, that regenerate perſons doe alwayes, and in euery particular act, both will good and doe good. No: ſometimes they will and deſire to doe good, and either they doe it not, or at the leaſt they doe it not as it ought to be done: but when they will good and doe good, it is God that works both in them: that is the meaning of the Apoſtle: and ſo not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, it remaynes a truth, that the Apoſtle was truly regenerate, when he ſpake thus of himſelfe, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good.</hi> And his meaning is, That as hee was rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, hee had a will and deſire to doe good, but many times he was hindred, and was not able either to doe the good he deſired, or he was not able to doe it, as it ought to be done. Thus then briefly conceiue we the Apoſtles meaning in theſe words, <hi>For to will is preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good:</hi> as if hee had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For to will, and to chooſe good, to purpoſe good, and to deſire to doe that which is good, is ready and at hand, and not to ſeeke with me, as I am regenerate and renued by grace; but through that corruption that ſtill in part abides in mee, I am hindred in doing that good, ſo as I find that I want ability and power many times to accompliſh that good I purpoſe and deſire to doe, or at leaſt, to perfect good things as I would, and to doe them without imperfection, as they ought to be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt note wee hence, how the Apoſtle confirmes it, that <hi>there was no good thing dwelling in him,</hi> that is, <hi>in his fleſh,</hi> and how he knew it ſo to be, namely thus; he found, that as hee was regenerate, there was in him a
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:422:189"/> will to good, a purpoſe to doe good, but yet hee was hindred in the doing of it, ſo as either hee did it not at all, or hee did it vntowardly: by this hee knew it, and was well acquainted with it, that in him, namely, in his fleſh, there was no good thing abiding. Whence take we notice of it in a word,</p>
               <p>That men may know that they haue no good thing in them, <label type="milestone">

               <p>If then thou that art a child of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> if thou (I ſay) wouldſt ſee and diſcerne the naughtineſſe of thine owne heart,

               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To will is preſent with mee,</hi> to will and to chooſe good, to purpoſe good, and to deſire to doe that which is good, is ready and at hand, and not to ſeeke with mee, as I am regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and renued by grace, wee are giuen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>That Gods children, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">To will good is ready, and at hand, with Gods childre, as they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</note> but through grace, to will that which is truely good, yea, it followes from hence, that GODS children haue in them a ready purpoſe of heart, and a ready deſire to doe good things, and to pleaſe God in all things; to will good, is ready and at hand with Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as they bee regenerate, and renued by the Spirit of grace.</p>
               <p>And touching this, for the euidence and truth of it, wee haue not onely the example of the Apoſtle in this place, but the examples of other Saints and Children of God, as of <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 40. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>I deſired to doe thy will, O my God,</hi>

And many other examples might be brought to this purpoſe, confirming this truth, that Gods children haue in them a power not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but through grace, to will and to chooſe that which is truely good, yea, as they are regenerate, they haue in them a ready purpoſe of heart, and a ready deſire to doe good things: And the reaſon is this,</p>

               <p>But haply here ſome will moue this queſtion: <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Haue Gods children at all times a will to good, and is it euer preſent with them to will that which is truely good, and alwayes in the like meaſure?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> That though Gods children haue in them at all times a power, through grace, to will that which is good, yet ſometimes they doe not will this or that particular good actually, neither doe they will this or that particular good, which haply they will actually, alwayes in the like meaſure, but ſometimes weakely, and ſometimes more ſtrongly, as in time of tryall, and time of temptation they doe not haply wil this or that particular good actually, or if they will it, yet not in the like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as at other times. But yet this ſtill remaynes a truth, that through that grace that is in them, they haue power to will that which is truly good, and as they are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:422:190"/> and in generall they haue in them a ready purpoſe, and a ready deſire to doe good things. Now then for the vſe of this: Firſt,</p>

Doſt thou no ſooner heare of any good duty required of thee, but thine heart anſwers, I will doe it, and to will to doe it is preſent with mee? Certainely that is an infallible euidence that thou art a child of God. But on the other ſide, if thou find that when good duties are required at thine hand, and thou art called on to doe good things, as to heare the Word of God, to pray, to ſanctifie the Sabbath, and ſuch like, thou art auerſe and repugnant to theſe things, and thine heart and mind goes againſt theſe things, thou haſt no mind to them; deceiue not thy ſelfe, thou art not yet in the ſtate of regeneration, no, thou art yet in the ſtate of nature, and till thine heart be changed, thou canſt haue no comfort in that ſtate.</p>
               <p>Againe, for a ſecond vſe, is it ſo, that Gods children, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> and ſuch as are truely regenerate, haue in them power,
<note place="margin">Comfort for ſuch as find in themſelues a readineſſe to will good things.</note> through grace, to will that which is truely good, and as they are regenerate, they haue in them a ready purpoſe of heart, and a ready deſire to doe good things? Then here is a ground of comfort for thee, whoſoeuer thou art that findeſt in thee, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>a willing mind,</hi> and a readineſſe to will good things. Doſt thou find in thee a ready purpoſe of heart, and a ready de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to doe the will of God? and doſt thou find, that (the Lord calling on thee, to doe this or that good duety) thine heart anſwers readily, I will doe it, I purpoſe to doe it, I deſire in my heart to doe it? Comfort thy ſelfe; that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:422:191"/> is a ſure euidence of thy regeneration, and that thou haſt true grace in thine heart: for as it is a note of a wicked man, willingly to purpoſe to liue in any knowne ſinne; ſo is it a note of a child of God, to haue a will ready and prepared to doe the will of God, and in euery thing to pleaſe God. If then it be the ready purpoſe of thine heart, and the ready deſire of thy ſoule, to doe good things, and to will good things is preſent with thee, and thou findeſt in thee an heart ready and prepared to doe good things, and thou ſetteſt thy ſelfe purpoſely to doe them, vſing carefully all good meanes to that end, that is a ſure teſtimony that thou art regenerate, a child of God, and in the ſtate of grace and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Now from this that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To will is proſent with me but to performe I find not.</hi> His meaning being this, as we ſhewed, that to will good, to purpoſe good, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to doe good, was ready and at hand with him, as hee was regenerate, but yet through corruption ſtill abiding in him, hee found that hee wanted ability many times ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accompliſh the good he deſired to doe, or if hee did any good thing, that hee was not able to doe it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, as it ought to be done. Hence two things offer themſelues: I will ſpeake of them in order. Firſt, this hence we are giuen to vnderſtand:</p>
               <p>That howſoeuer to will good, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>7</label> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to doe good,
<note place="margin">Gods children many times want ability to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>And to make this further manifeſt, that Text is cleere to this purpoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. where Chriſt ſaith of his
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:422:191"/> Diſciples, <hi>The Spirit indeed is ready, but the fleſh is weake.</hi> As if he had ſaid, There is in you a readineſſe of Spirit, there is in you a ready will and purpoſe to watch with me, but through the weakneſſe of your fleſh, you are not able to doe that good you would, you cannot doe that good you purpoſe and deſire to doe. And hence it was (no doubt) that <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 119.106. bound himſelfe with an Oath to keepe the righteous Iudgements of the Lord, <hi>I haue ſworne, and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous Iudgements.</hi> If <hi>Dauid</hi> had found no weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, no miſtruſt, nor doubtfulneſſe in himſelfe, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not ſo ſtraightly to haue bound himſelfe: but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, that howſoeuer he had in him, as he was rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, a will to good, a purpoſe and deſire to doe good things, yet through the corruption of his nature ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in him in part, there was in him a weakeneſſe and want of ability to doe good things: hee therefore did prouoke and ſtirre vp himſelfe to a greater care, by an Oath and ſolemne Couenant made with God.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Dauids</hi> example wee ſee, how it is with the beſt of Gods children, that howſoeuer to will good, to purpoſe good, to deſire to doe good things, is ready, and at hand, and preſent with them, as they be regenerate, yet many times through that corruption that ſtill abides in them, they want ability to doe good, they are not able to doe the good things they purpoſe and deſire to doe, and one reaſon of it is giuen by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.
<note place="margin">

And hence it is that many times they are hindred, and cannot doe the good things they would.</p>
               <p>Againe, a ſecond reaſon of it is this: It is God that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:422:192"/> works in his children both the will and deed,

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. broke out into magnifying and prayſing the Name of the Lord, for that the Lord had not only made him and his people, willing to offer, but had alſo enabled them to offer indeed. <hi>Who am I</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and what is my people, that wee ſhould be able to offer willingly after this ſort? for all things come of thee, and of thine owne hand haue we giuen thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now God ſometimes is pleaſed to with-hold his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting grace from his children, euen that grace that ſhould aſſiſt them in doing of good: and thence alſo it is, that they are not able many times to do the good things they purpoſe and deſire to doe, and though to will be preſent with them, yet to doe this or that particular good, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to ſeeke with them, through that corruption that ſtill abides in them, they are hindred and they are not able to doe it: and thus it is euen with the beſt of Gods children.

               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">

To will good, is preſent to Gods children, as they be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: but to doe this or that particular good, is many times to ſeeke with them, through that corruption that ſtill abides in them: and therefore if wee find our ſelues enabled by grace to will that which is truly good, if wee find in vs at any time a purpoſe and deſire of doing any good thing, we muſt not preſume of our owne wiſdome, will and ſtrength for the doing of it, but we muſt deſire further ſtrength from God to enable vs to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it: it is Gods grace that wee are able to will good, and to purpoſe and deſire to doe good truly; but yet there is a further grace required for the doing of that good; and if that grace be not likewiſe giuen, wee ſhall
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:422:192"/> neuer doe it. Now, when we haue done one good thing, we cannot doe a ſecond, but by a new ſupply of grace. When therefore wee finde our hearts diſpoſed to good things, as DAVIDS <hi>heart was to pray,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. when our hearts are prepared and ready to do any good thing, wee may not vndertake the doing of it otherwiſe then thus, euen with a denyall of all power in our ſelues, and with earneſt crauing the preſence of Gods Spirit and Grace, without which wee cannot purpoſe, much leſſe performe any thing that is truly good; and in euery good thing we doe, wee muſt giue all glory to God: for hee it is that makes vs able both to will and to do good things.</p>
               <p>Againe, for a ſecond vſe, is it ſo, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> that Gods children are not able many times to doe the good things they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deſire to doe? and though to will good,
<note place="margin">Comfort for ſuch as find in themſelues a purpoſe to doe good things, and yet find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnable to performe them.</note> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, yet to doe this or that particular good, is many times to ſeeke with them, through the corruption that ſtill abides in them: they are like to priſoners that haue eſcaped out of priſon, who would goe twenty miles in an houre, but are not able to goe one mile. Is it thus with the beſt of Gods children? Then be not thou, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art, too much deiected and caſt downe, that findeſt in thy ſelfe a purpoſe and a deſire to doe good things, and yet withall findeſt thy ſelfe vnable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them.</p>
               <p>For example: Art thou able to ſay in truth of heart, I would be more humbled for my ſinnes, I would faine weepe and ſhead teares for my ſinnes, but mine heart is hard and I cannot doe it; I would faine pray with more feeling and more feruency, I would heare the Word with more cheerefulneſſe and delight: but, alas, I find in my ſelfe a deadneſſe and dulneſſe, and I cannot doe theſe good things as I would? is it thus with thee? Comfort thy ſelfe, thy caſe is no other then the caſe of all Gods children: thus it hath beene with them, and thus it will be with the beſt of Gods children. Looke that thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:422:193"/> and deſire after theſe good things, be in truth, and vnfained, and that thou be carefull to cheriſh it, ſtriuing againſt thy hardneſſe, deadneſſe, and dulneſſe of heart, and vſing all good meanes that may bring that purpoſe and deſire of thine into act; and then though thou bee not able to bring it forth into act, yet know to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it is no otherwiſe with thee, then with the deareſt of Gods Children; thy caſe and theirs is alike: the Lord is pleaſed to trie thee whether thou wilt continue ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt thy corruption or no. And if thou ſo doe, hee will at length giue thee power againſt it; and in the meane time aſſure thy ſelfe, hee accepts thy will for the deed, as hee doth at the hands of his Children: and let that be thy comfort.</p>
               <p>Now in the ſecond thing offered from hence, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To will</hi> good, to purpoſe good, <hi>is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with mee,</hi> but <hi>through that corruption that ſtill abides in me,</hi> I finde that I want abilitie either to accompliſh the good I deſire to doe, or if I doe any good thing, that I am not able to doe it perfectly as I ought. Hence we are taught;</p>
               <p>That the good things Gods Children doe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>8</label> they doe them not perfectly;
<note place="margin">Gods children doe not good things perfitly.</note> it is not poſſible for any Childe of God to doe any good ſo perfectly, as that there ſhould be no euill found in his action: no, no: as ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah, Iſai.</hi> 64.6. <hi>All our righteouſneſſe is as filthie clouts.</hi> The beſt actions Gods Children doe, are pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defiled, and there is ſinne cleauing to them, and it muſt needs be ſo: for why?</p>
               <p>GODS Children are not perfectly renued by grace; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> there is ſtill corruption in part abiding in them. Sinfull deſires are neuer wholly wanting to them, but they haue them ſtill in part in them: and therefore they cannot performe good things perfectly, but there muſt needs be ſome want, and ſome defect cleauing to the beſt of their actions, <hi>Ionah,</hi> 4.2. It is ſaid, that IONAH <hi>prayed
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:422:193"/> vnto the Lord.</hi> But if wee read the place, wee ſhall finde, that hee did it maruellous vntowardly, it was rather a quarrelling with God, then a praying vnto him. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the good things that Gods Children doe, they doe them exceeding vntowardly, and they cannot poſſibly doe good things perfectly.</p>
               <p>Obiect. The workes of God are perfect, <label type="milestone">

And ſo it is ſtill a certaine truth, that the good things Gods Children doe, they doe them not perfectly, but there is euill and ſinne cleauing to the beſt of their actions.</p>
               <p>Now this for the vſe of it, firſt, <label type="milestone">

This is an errour plainely conuinced by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine now deliuered: and indeed it is a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, not only to doe euill, but to faile in the doing of good, and it deſerues the Curſe of God, and from ſuch fayling none are freed, no not the beſt of Gods Children: And therefore, it is erroneous and falſe, to ſay that the Regenerate may perfectly fulfill the Law of God in time of this life.</p>

So hee reaſons: <hi>to will is preſent with mee, but I finde no meanes to performe that which is good:</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>I doe not the good thing which I would.</hi> And that is further amplified by the contrarie effect in reſpect of <hi>euill:</hi> the Apoſtle affirmes on the contrarie, that the euill which he would not doe, that hee did, <hi>But the euill which I would not, that doe I.</hi> And ſo wee haue the dependance of this Verſe, on foregoing matter, and the ſumme and ſubſtance of it.</p>
               <p>The words of this Verſe neede not much to bee ſtood on, touching the ſence of them, wee had the ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Verſe 15. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>What I would, that doe I not, but what I hate that doe I.</hi> I will briefly runne them ouer. <hi>(For I doe not the good thing which I would.)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpretation</note> By <hi>good thing,</hi> wee are to vnderſtand, that which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and truely good, and pleaſing to God: and the Word here rendred <hi>(doe)</hi> ſignifies to act, effect and bring forth <hi>Which I would:</hi> that is, which I, as I am regenerate, would act and doe, and which I purpoſe and earneſtly deſire to doe. <hi>But the euill which I would not.</hi> By euill is here meant the contrarie to the good before ſpoken of, namely, the <hi>euill of ſinne,</hi> and that is repugnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:422:195"/> to the Law of God, and diſpleaſing to God. <hi>Which I would not,</hi> that is, as before I ſhewed, which I, as I am regenerate, would not doe, that I doe, that I act and doe, and bring forth: yet this (as heretofore I ſaid) is not to be vnderſtood as if the Apoſtle had beene forced to doe euill againſt his will, but that he conſented not to it with his whole will, hee being now regenerate, the euill hee now did, was not with the full and whole conſent of his will.</p>
               <p>And againe, we muſt know, that the Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>he did not the good thing which he would haue done,</hi> wee are to vnderſtand it, that ſo it was with him many times, not alwayes, that many times he did it not; and on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, in ſaying, <hi>The euill which hee would not, that hee did,</hi> wee are likewiſe to conceiue it, that ſo it was with him many times, not alwayes.</p>
               <p>Thus then take wee vp the Apoſtles meaning in the wordes of this Verſe, as if hee had ſaid, For the good thing, euen that thing that is truely good and pleaſing to God, which I, as I am regenerate, would act and doe, and which I purpoſe and earneſtly deſire to doe, many times I doe not, I act not, I effect it not, I bring it not forth: but on the other ſide, the euill that is repugnant, and contrarie to the Law of GOD, and diſpleaſing to God, which as I am regenerate, I would not doe, that many times I act, and bring forth, and that many times I doe. Wee ſhall ſtand the leſſe while on this Verſe, becauſe we had it in ſubſtance before, Verſe 15. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here repeates that in ſubſtance, which there hee layde downe, as likewiſe in Verſe 20. hee repeates that which we had Verſe 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Now this the Apoſtle did not for want of matter; hee was full of heauenly matter, neither was it idly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably done, but to good purpoſe, no doubt, to let vs vnderſtand, that the things hee here puts downe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſpirituall Combat, are things of waight and

               <p>And this ferues for the iuſt reproofe of many in the World: Many there bee that are defectiue, and come ſhort of their dutie in this reſpect, they haue little or no regard of that the Lord ſpeakes to them in his Word,

To inſtance in ſome particulars,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10.</note> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>The vnrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And he reckons vp particulars, <hi>Neither Fornicaters, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Wantons, nor Buggerers, nor The eues, nor Couetous, nor Drunkards, nor Raylers, nor Extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peates the ſame againe,

               </p>
               <p>Now, where is that Whoremonger, that Filthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Drunkard, that according to this doubled threatning, doubles his regard of it, and his care to bee bettered by it to this reformation? where is almoſt ſuch an one to be found? Nay, doe not many Filthy perſons, and Drunkards, and ſuch like, euen blunt the edge of Gods thteatnings on the hardneſſe of their hearts? Well, thinke on it, whoſoeuer thou art: Hath the Lord ſpoken a thing, and ſhall not hee doe it? Hath hee threatned Iudgements againſt thee for thy ſinne, and that againe, and againe, and ſhall not hee bee as good as his word? Yes, aſſuredly; Vnleſſe thou anſwere the Lord in dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his threatnings by a ſound and through reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will bring his threatned Iudgements on thee; yea, know it for a truth, thou that goeſt on in thy knowne ſinne, notwithſtanding the Lord doubles his threates of Iudgement againſt thee, either in his written Word, or
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:422:196"/> in the Miniſterie of his Word, the Lord directing his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters often to hit vpon the ſin, &amp; iuſtly to denounce the Iudgements of God againſt thee for the ſame, thou doſt in an high degree <hi>reſiſt the Spirit of God, Act.</hi> 7.51. and as it is <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.25. <hi>Thou deſpiſeſt all the Counſels of God.</hi> And aſſure thy ſelfe, the Lord will deale with thee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably; he will certainely double his Plagues and Iudgements on thee.</p>
               <p>Repetitions in Scripture, or in the Miniſterie of the Word, are not idle and vaine: no, no, they ſignifie the infallible truth of the things repeated, and that wee are more carefully to attend them, and to make vſe of them: and therefore when the Lord doubles his ſpeach in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing mercy, in commanding any dutie, and eſpecially in threatning Iudgement againſt ſinne; let vs looke wee anſwere the Lord, in doubling our attention and care to profit by the ſame: otherwiſe, the Lord will one day certainely require it at our hands, and wee ſhall ſmart for it. Now from this Verſe, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>hee did not the good thing which he would;</hi> hee would haue done good, but he did it not, he points out to vs,</p>
               <p>That the good which Gods children would doe, <label type="milestone">

And againe, in that he ſaith, <hi>The good thing which I would, I do not,</hi> but <hi>the euill which I would not, that doe I:</hi> wee might further note,</p>
               <p>That Gods children are neuer ſo giuen ouer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> as to ſinne with the whole will, and with full conſent of will:
<note place="margin">Gods children neuer ſinne with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will.</note> for when they omit the doing of good, or faile in the doing of any good, they would not ſo doe; or when they doe euill, they would not doe it, they doe it not with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will. But theſe things we haue formerly handled; therefore I paſſe by them. And the point I will ſtand on, hence offered, is this: In that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I doe not the good thing that I would, but the euill that I would not,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:422:197"/> that doe I.</hi> Hence wee are giuen to vnderſtand,</p>
               <p>That Gods children doe not onely ſometimes omit the doing of good, <label type="milestone">

Gods children not onely ſinne by fayling in performance of good duties, but ſometimes alſo by euill actions, euen by ſuch actions as are ſimply euill in themſelues, and directly contrary to the Law. Thus did the Apoſtle, he did euill. And thus wee finde that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſinned by lying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.2. <hi>Iob</hi> by impatiencie, <hi>Iob</hi> 3. <hi>Ezechiah</hi> by vaine-glory, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Moſes</hi> by ſpeaking vnaduiſedly, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.10.

               </p>
               <p>Now if any demand why the Lord ſuffers his children ſo to be ouertaken? <label type="milestone">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe our Apoſtle further confirmes that Propoſition, that howſoeuer, as he was regenerate, he willed good, yet hee was not able to performe it, from the cauſe of hinderance. He here points out the true and right cauſe of it, whence it was that hee was hindred in doing of good, that he could not doe it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his owne in-dwelling corruption; yea, he ſaith, that it was from his owne in-dwelling corruption, that he did the euill that hee would not haue done. And this Verſe containes in it an inference brought in, on that hee ſaid Verſe before, that <hi>the euill hee would not doe, that hee did.</hi> Thereupon the Apoſtle concludes, that it was not he that did the euill. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I doe that I would not, it is not I that doe it.</hi> And he amplifies that by a note of difference touching himſelfe, in regard of his preſent condition compared with his former, that howſoeuer in former times it was he that did it, yet now it was no more hee that did the euill that was done by him. <hi>If I doe that I would not, it is no more I that doe it.</hi> And then hee further ſhewes, what it was that did it, namely, his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling corruption: but, ſaith he, <hi>the ſinne that dwelleth in me, that doth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle heere, as I ſaid, repeates the ſelfe-ſame thing hee deliuered Verſe 16, 17. and in the very ſame words: and therefore we need not ſtand on the opening of them, but onely call to mind and remember how they haue beene formerly expounded. And thus, as you may
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:422:198"/> remember, we expounded them, and thus they are to be conceiued, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now then, if I doe that euill which I would not doe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpretation</note> 
                  <hi>it is no longer I as I am regenerate, and ſo farre forth as I am regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that doe that euill, but the ſinfull corruption that ſtill in part remaines in mee, and hath a powerfull and working pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in mee, euen forcibly croſsing the motions of the Spirit in mee, and haling and pulling me to euill, that is it that doth the euill that is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Verſe being but a repetition of that which was before deliuered, I will paſſe by things formerly handled, and onely ſpeake of ſuch things as may hence be further gathered. The Papiſts, but to point at a note of theirs on theſe two Verſes 19, 20. haue this annotation: ſay they, That which the Apoſtle heere ſpeakes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, makes nothing againſt Free-will, but plainely proues it: and how ſo? Why (ſay they) becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of the will, namely, to will or nill, to conſent or diſſent, is euer free in it ſelfe, as heere wee may ſee in the Apoſtle, though the operation may bee hindred by ſome externall force: yea, (ſay they) in that the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">How the will of man is free.</note> 
                  <hi>If I doe that I would not, it is no more I that doe it,</hi> it doth moſt euidently proue Free-will: that is their note on this place.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, It is true indeed, that the act of the will, namely, to will or nill, to conſent or diſſent, is euer free: but how? Surely thus; in the vnregenerate it is free from coaction and compulſion, but not from a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie alwayes of willing that which is euill, and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, of which ſtate the Apoſtle here ſpeakes in his owne perſon, the will is reformed by grace, and made free to will that which is truely good, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.36. <hi>If the Sonne make you free,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.36.</note> 
                  <hi>then yee ſhall be free indeed.</hi> And ſo this place makes nothing for the proofe of the naturall ſtrength and power of the will to that which is good, that the will of man hath a power in it
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:422:199"/> ſelfe, and by it ſelfe, to will that which is good, either in the ſtate of Nature or Grace, which is the point in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene vs and the Papiſts. No, this place ſhewes plainely, that the will regenerate, is onely by grace ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to will that which is good, and that the will hath power, not in it ſelfe, or by it ſelfe, but by grace to will good, and to nill euill, and that onely in part, and not perfectly. So much theſe two Verſes will affoord to vs touching freedome of will, and no more.</p>
               <p>I proceed: <hi>If I doe that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but the ſinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> The Apoſtle ſtill (which likewiſe I wil note in a word) calls concupiſcence that remained in him, <hi>Sinne,</hi> and he giues to it the name of <hi>Sinne.</hi> Yea, ſay the Papiſts, it is called ſinne, but not properly and truely, but improperly, either becauſe it is the effect of ſinne, as the Writing is called the Hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was written with the hand, or for that it is the cauſe of ſinne; as Cold is called Slothfull, becauſe it makes a man ſlothfull.
<note place="margin">Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence is both the effect of ſinne, the cauſe of ſinne, and ſinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo truely and properly.</note> A ſilly ſhift! For concupiſcence may be, and indeed is, both the effect of ſinne, the cauſe of ſinne, and ſinne alſo truely and properly in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> it is the effect of ſinne; in regard of actuall ſinnes, it is the mother and cauſe of ſinne; and it is alſo in it ſelfe truely and properly ſinne, becauſe it is not agreeable to Gods Law, but directly contrary to it, and ſhould not haue beene in man, if man had kept his ſtate of Innocencie, and had not broken the Law of God. And as one ſaith well, What can be more abſurd, then to deny that to bee ſinne properly, that is contrary to God, to his Spirit, and to the Law of God? Therefore this is but a poore ſhift of the Papiſts, to ſay, that Concupiſcence is the effect of ſin, or cauſe of ſinne, and therefore not properly ſinne. I leaue them.</p>
               <p>In the next place obſerue we, the Apoſtle blames his owne corruption, as the roote and cauſe of the euill
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:422:199"/> he did vnwillingly; hee layes the fault and blame where it ought to lye, namely, on his owne in-dwelling cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that hee did the euill hee would not haue done: ſaith he, <hi>It is not I, but the ſinne that dwelleth in mee,</hi> that doth it.</p>
               <p>And indeed thus it ought to be with vs:
<note place="margin">Our owne corruption is the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery euill thing we doe.</note> We are to lay the fault of euery euill thing we doe, on the rottenneſſe and corruption of our owne hearts, and we are to blame that as the true and proper cauſe of that euill: for why? as it is <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Euery man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his owne concupiſcence, and is intiſed.</hi> It is a mans owne concupiſcence, and the corruption of his owne heart, that drawes euery man to ſinne, and were there not corruption of nature ſtill in part abiding in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Deuill could neuer faſten any temptation on them, neither could the world nor any thing in the world draw them on any ſinne.</p>
               <p>The Deuil ſet on Chriſt and tempted him, but in vaine: for <hi>he found nought in him, Ioh.</hi> 14.30. And ſo, if Gods children were altogether without corruption, the Deuill could not force any temptation on them, &amp; they ſhould neuer ſinne at all: and therefore we are to lay the fault of euery euill thing we doe, on the corruption of our owne hearts, and blame that as the true and proper cauſe of it. Lay not the fault of that euill thou doſt, on any thing out of thy ſelfe as the cauſe of it. For example: thou being brought into pouerty, or into ſome trouble, it may be, thou falleſt by indirect meanes to helpe thy ſelfe; thou betrayeſt the good cauſe thou haſt in hand, if thou ſo do: lay not the fault of that euill thou doſt, on thy pouerty, or on the extreme hard dealing of men. No, no: thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, and the extreme dealing of men, may be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that euill thou doſt, but certainly, the cauſe of it is in thy ſelfe, euen in thine owne boſome, the corruption of thine owne heart. It was not <hi>the want of the feare of God in the place that cauſed</hi> ABRAHAM <hi>to lye, Gen.</hi> 20.2.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:422:200"/> That indeed was the occaſion of his lying; but the cauſe of it was his owne thought, his owne doubting &amp; feare, ariſing from the corruption of his owne heart, as appears plainly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.2, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. Saith ABRAHAM, <hi>I thought this ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The feare of God is not in this place, and they will ſlay me for my wiues ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt learne then, when wee doe any euill, not to blame any thing out of our ſelues, but to lay the fault where it ought to lye, namely, on the naughtineſſe of our owne hearts, as the true and proper cauſe of it, and wee are to bee humbled for that, as for the euill it ſelfe; that is our dutie. I only point at it in a word, becauſe we ſpake of it at large, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Now laſtly, in that the Apoſtle vſeth this phraſe, <hi>Sinne that dwelleth in me,</hi> he giues vs to vnderſtand,</p>
               <p>That the corruption of nature is a different thing from the powers of the ſoule:
<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature is a different thing from the powers of the ſoule.</note> for wee know that the dweller differs, and is really diſtinguiſhed from the houſe where he dwels: and ſo the corruption of nature dwelling in vs, it muſt needes bee conceiued to bee a reall diſtinct thing from the ſoule, and from the powers and faculties of it, and it is not a corruption of the ſubſtance of the ſoule; for then the ſoule could not be immortal, if the ſubſtance of it were corrupted, neither could Chriſt haue taken on him mans Nature, without ſinne: but the corruption of Nature is a thing that dwels and abides in the ſoule, and a thing that cleaues to the faculties of it, and to the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart, and it is ſuch a thing as may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the ſoule by the powerfull worke of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And hence it is called an euill that compaſſeth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Caſt away euery thing, that preſſeth downe, and the ſinne that hangeth ſo faſt on,</hi> or, doth ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compaſſe about; for ſo the word ſignifies. And thoſe exhortations that are frequent in the Scripture, <hi>Caſt, or Put off the old man,</hi> doe giue vs to vnderſtand as much, That the corruption of Nature is not a corruption of the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:422:200"/> ſubſtance of the ſoule, but a reall diſtinct thing from the ſoule, and a thing that cleaues to the faculties of it, and to the affections of the heart, and a thing that may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the ſoule by the powerfull worke of Gods Spirit. And this for the vſe of it,</p>
               <p>Teacheth vs, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that regeneration doth not aboliſh any facultie of the ſoule,
<note place="margin">Regeneration doth not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſoule or any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hart, but it only takes away the filthineſſe of them.</note> nor any naturall affection of the heart, but it onely takes away the filthineſſe and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, euen that corruption that dwels in the ſoule and cleaues to the faculties and powers of it; and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is a man truely regenerate, when that corruption that is naturally in the powers of his ſoule, and in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his heart, is remoued: And a man may know that he is regenerate, by this, as by a ſpeciall note; If ſo be a man find the affections of his heart, eſpecially the chiefe and ruling affections of it, ſtill as ſtrong, and as powerfull in him as euer they were, and yet the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them in a good meaſure remoued and taken away, then hee is truely regenerate. For example: Doſt thou find thy naturall affection of ioy, of delight, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as ſtrong and as powerfull in thee as euer it was, and that the ſinfulneſſe and corruption of that affection is remoued? Doſt thou find now, that thou canſt as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily reioyce and delight thy ſelfe as euer thou couldſt, not in ſinne and in outward things, not in carnall pleaſure, in Drunkenneſſe, in Good-fellowſhip and merry meetings, and ſuch like, but in the loue &amp; fauour of God in Chriſt, in obedience to his will, in the duties of his worſhip, in hearing the Word, in Prayer, and ſuch like, and it is now the ioy of thine heart to be exerciſed in holy things? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is a ſpeciall euidence and teſtimony that thou art truly regenerate, &amp; that the Spirit of God hath wrought powerfully in thee.</p>
               <p>So for the affection of anger: Doſt thou find that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as ſtrong in thee as euer it was, and yet the ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of it remoued? Doſt thou find that now thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

Surely, then thou maiſt thereupon conclude to the comfort of thine owne ſoule, that thou art truely regenerate, thy affection ſtill remaynes, but the corruption of it is in ſome good meaſure remoued and taken away, and ſo we may trie our ſelues in other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and let vs remember this, that the corruption of nature is not a corruption of the ſubſtance of the ſoule, but a reall diſtinct thing from the ſoule, a thing that cleaues to the faculties of the ſoule, and the affections of the heart, and may be ſeuered from the ſoule, by the powerfull worke of Gods Spirit; and ſo Regeneration doth not aboliſh any facultie of the ſoule, nor any affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, but only takes away the filthineſſe and corruption that cleaues to them, and then indeed we are truely regenerate, when the affections of our hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in full force and ſtrength, and the ſinfulneſſe of them is remoued.</p>

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:422:201"/> was hindred by euill, that was readie and at hand, and ſtood vp in his way. And this Verſe contaynes another concluſion, inferd on foregoing matter: and here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle further concludes, that hee being willing to doe good, as he was regenerate, there was, as it were, a Law laid on him to the contrary, and he was as it were inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the contrary, and hee was vnder ſuch a condition, as hee could not doe that good: and hee makes knowne what that Law was, namely, <hi>euill that was preſent with him:</hi> yea, he amplifies this from his owne experience, that he found it ſo in his owne experience. <hi>I find,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>when I would doe good, there is a Law,</hi> or this Law, <hi>to the contrary, euen euill preſent with mee:</hi> and that hinders mee that I cannot doe it.

The word <hi>Law</hi> is here diuerſly taken by diuers Interpreters; ſome take it in the good part, for the Law of God, others in the euill part, for the Law of ſinne and corruption. I will not trouble you with varietie of Interpretations, but giue you that meaning of it which I conceiue to be moſt agreeable to the Context; and as I take it, the word <hi>(Law)</hi> is here put to ſignifie a ſtrong &amp; forcible power, euen ſuch a power as hath in it the force and ſtrength of a Law, that is, a commanding, a controlling, and a binding power.</p>
               <p>And that the word <hi>Law</hi> in this place, is thus to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, may plainly appeare by the vſe of it, <hi>

So it is with Gods Children; yea, the more holy a man is, the more hee ſees and finds in his owne experience, that <hi>when he would doe good, euill is preſent with him.</hi> And ſo it muſt be with thee, if thou wouldeſt approue thy ſelfe a Childe of God: and this is no matter of vtter diſcouragement.</p>
               <p>Now further: In that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When I would doe good, euill.</hi> as a Law, <hi>is preſent with me,</hi> ſome euill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, luſt or deſire is readie and at hand, countermanding and controlling the good I purpoſe, and deſire in my heart: Hence we are giuen to vnderſtand,</p>
               <p>That it is the common condition of all Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">The good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are euer either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or troubled, or mingled with ſome euill motions.</note> that the good motions that come from the Spirit of grace in them, are euer either interrupted or troubled, or they are mingled with ſome euill motions that ariſe from that corruption that ſtill abides in them. In the beſt of Gods Children there is euer ſome euill, readie and at hand to countermand and controll them, when they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deſire to doe any good thing, and no ſooner doe GODS Children purpoſe and deſire to doe any good thing, or attempt, or ſet on the doing of it, but there is ſome euill motion or luſt preſent and readie to hinder them, preſently either pride, or ſelfe-loue, or Vain-glorie, Hypocriſie, or doubt, or feare, or the like, ſtarts vp in them and lookes them in the face, and controlls them,

               <p>And hence alſo it was, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſeeing the people to offer willingly and with ioy, hee thus prayed for them, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>O Lord God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>of</hi> ABRAHAM,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe two Verſes our Apoſtle layes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs the third degree of the ſpirituall combate betweene the fleſh and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in them that are truely regenerate, ſtill inſiſting in his owne example, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this, that his delight was in good, touching his inner man, but yet he was led captiue by the law of his members to ſinne: ſo that here the Apoſtle makes knowne in his owne perſon, the ſpirituall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat more fully and plainely, and in a further degree: for to delight in the Law of God, is more then to will good, and to haue the law of the members rebelling againſt the Law of the minde, is more then ſimply to will euill, or to doe euill. For the connexion of theſe Verſes with fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going matter, we haue here a proofe of that the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. That <hi>when he would doe good, euill,</hi> as a law, <hi>was preſent with him;</hi> from this, that the Law of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers rebelled againſt the Law of his minde, and led him captiue vnto the law of ſinne, which was in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and that is amplified by his delight in the Law of God, that though he delighted in the Law of God in his inner man, yet the law of his members rebelled againſt the Law of his minde: and therefore when he would doe good, euill, as a law, was preſent with him. That is the dependance of theſe two Verſes on the Verſe foregoing, and the generall matter of them.</p>
               <p>Come wee to handle them ſeuerally. In the two and twentieth Verſe the Apoſtle makes knowne his delight in the Law of God; that he delighted in the Law of God: and leſt he ſhould be miſtaken, he explaines himſelfe, by
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:422:205"/> limiting his ſpeech to <hi>the Inner man,</hi> that is, was in his inner man that he delighted in the Law of God. <hi>I delight</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Law of God, concerning the inner man.</hi> And ſo the matter of this Verſe, is the Apoſtles delight in the Law of God, expreſſed with reſtraint of that delight to his <hi>Inner man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I delight in the Law of God:</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> I take pleaſure and ioy, yea much pleaſure and great ioy, I finde much ſweetneſſe and pleaſure: for ſo the word ſignifieth in the Originall. And by the Law of God we are here to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Morall Law, which the Apoſtle, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 12. ſaid, <hi>was holy, and iuſt, and good:</hi> which makes knowne the good will of God, touching all good duties, both of piety towards God, and of loue, and iuſtice, and mercy towards men. In this Law the Apoſtle tooke pleaſure and delight, and that in the knowledge and meditation of it, and in the practice of the duties therein required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the Inner man.</hi> Some would haue onely the mind &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to be ment: but indeed that comes too ſhort of the purpoſe &amp; meaning of that Phraſe. By <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> we are to vnderſtand the regenerat part through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, both in ſoule and in body, euen whatſoeuer is either within in the powers of the ſoule, or without in the parts &amp; members of the body, being renued by grace, and ſo far forth as they be regenerate and renued. And the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part is thus called the <hi>Inner man,</hi> becauſe Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is chiefly ſeated in the heart, and in the minde, and in, in the inward powers &amp; faculties of the ſoule, &amp; doth diffuſe and ſpread it ſelfe from thence, to the parts and members of the body:
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29.</note> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. that <hi>true Circumciſion is of the heart, and in the Spirit.</hi> And hence it is called, <hi>The Hid man of the heart,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Let the hid man of the heart be vncorrupt.</hi> That is one ſpeciall reaſon why the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part is called <hi>The Inner man.</hi>

               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:422:206"/>
               <p>Now then, thus conceiue we the Apoſtles meaning in the words of this Verſe, as if he had ſaid: <hi>For I, as I am regenerate, and in that part of me that is regenerate and renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace throughout, both in my ſoule and in my body, in the powers and faculties of the one, and in the parts and members of the other, do take great pleaſure &amp; much ioy in the good Law of God, commanding good duties, both of pietie towards God, &amp; of loue, iuſtice, and mercy towards men. I find much ſweetneſſe and pleaſure in the knowledge of that Law, and in meditating in the ſame, &amp; in the practice of good duties that are therin ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, according to that meaſure of grace that is giuen to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle here ſaith of himſelfe, that as he was regenerate, he delighted in the Law of God: The point hence is this,</p>
               <p>That Gods children, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Firſt, they are able to looke on the Law of God with a ſpirituall eye, and to ſee the beautie and excellency of it; euen therein to behold moſt abſolute holineſſe and righteouſneſſe ſet before them, yea, the very image of God Himſelfe, in reſpect of his perfect Iuſtice, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: and theſe things are moſt louely, and muſt needes affect and draw the hearts of Gods children to them.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſecondly Gods children know, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Morall Law is not the cauſe of eternall life, yet it is the rule of good life, and the way in which they are to walke that ſhall bee ſaued: and therefore they ioy and delight in the knowledge of it, and in meditating in it, and in the practice of the duties required in it, as iuſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered. <label type="milestone">

Is it the ioy of thine heart to be exerciſed in the dueties of pietie, in hearing the Word of God, in praying, in the duties of equitie, iuſtice, loue and mercy to towards men?

For though an hypocrite may delight in the Word of God promiſing mercy and good things, or teaching ſome things not ſo contrary to his humour, yet if either it diſcouer his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy corruption, or rebuke him for the ſame, then hee likes it not: and therefore if it be ſo with thee, that whether the Word comfort, or threaten, or rebuke, yet ſtill it is ſweet and pleaſant to thee: therein thou goeſt beyond an hypocrite.</p>
               <p>Againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if thou find that thy delight in the Word of God is a working delight, it works in thee an holy care and endeuour, to conforme thy ſelfe to the will of God, reuealed in his holy and righteous Law, and that as well in thy inward thoughts and affections, as in thy outward actions; therein certainly it goes beyond the delight of an hypocrite: his delight may make him doe ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things, and that is all; it neuer makes him ſtriue to ſubdue his reaſon, will, and affections, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>By theſe two notes then trie thy ſelfe, and neuer reſt, til thou find that thou doſt delight in the whole Law and Word of God, whether it teach comfort, or threaten, or rebuke, and that thy delight in the Word of God is a working delight, working in thee an holy care and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to conforme thy ſelfe to the holy will of God in all things, aſwell in thy thoughts and inward affections, as in thy outward actions: and thereupon thou maiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> that Gods children delight in the Law of God?
<note place="margin">Gods children find vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort in the Word of the Goſpel.</note> Doe they find ſweetneſſe in that that reueales ſinne, and doth accuſe and condemine for ſinne?

The world commonly thinks that the life of a true beleening Chriſtian, is without ioy; an heauy, lumpiſh, and vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life, and that there is no mirth in them that truly feare God, they liue a life without delight. Alas, poore ſoules! they are deceiued that ſo thinke; Gods children find ſweetneſſe and comfort in the Law of God, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them and wounding them for their ſins, and much more ſweetneſſe do they find in the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpell: yea, they find ſuch ſweetneſſe in them (being knowne, beleeued, and applyed to themſelues by a true faith) as they would not part withall for ten thouſand worlds: for thoſe binde vp their broken hearts &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſoules, with heauenly comfort, and they worke in them peace of conſcience, which is a continuall feaſt, and they ſettle them in aſſurance of right to eternall life, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and glorie in heauen, and doe giue them a taske and a beginning of that ioy, eye hath not ſeene, eare hath not heard, nor the heart of man conceiued: and therefore thou art deceiued, that thinkeſt they haue no delight, and liue a life without ioy.</p>
               <p>In that the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>He delighted in the Law of God, concerning the innerman;</hi> Hence alſo we gathered argument of his regeneration, that therefore the Apoſtle
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:422:209"/> was truly regenerate, becauſe his delight was in the Law of God concerning the inner man. As firſt this, in that he delighted in the knowledge of the Law of God, and in obedience to it. Therefore he was a man truely rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and againe in that here hee ſpeakes of his Inner man, thereby meaning his regenerate part, that therefore alſo he was a man truely regenerate.</p>
               <p>Now againſt this argument obiections are brought: we haue heretofore propounded the obiection that lyes againſt the firſt, and anſwered it, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. and therefore I paſſe by that, and I will now only propound the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made againſt the ſecond argument, and anſwere that, and then proceed.</p>
               <p>Thus then ſome doe obiect; ſay they, <hi>The Inner man</hi> doth not here ſignifie the regenerate part, but by <hi>Inner man,</hi> we are to vnderſtand the mind, as ſtanding in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the body: and for this they bring 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. where the Apoſtle ſaith, Though our outward manpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, yet the inward man is renued daily.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now to this I anſwere: <label type="milestone">

As for the Text alleaged, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. they miſvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, expounding the inward man to be the mind, and the outward man, the body.</p>
               <p>The Text it ſelfe is againſt that Expoſition; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, The inward man is renued daily. Now reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is not only of the mind, but it is alſo of all other powers and faculties of the ſoule, yea of all the parts and members of the body, and hee ſaith againe, Though our outward man periſh, or be corrupted; meaning, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in true beleeuers is by the Croſſe and by afflictions weakened, and diminiſhed, and purged out: and that is not only the corruption of the body, but the corruption alſo of the ſoule, and that chiefly euen the ſinfull luſts and deſires of the heart, loue of the world, loue of pleaſures, and carnall ioy and delight: and ſo that Text makes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt them, then for them. And whereas they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage the Apoſtles owne Expoſition in the laſt Verſe of this Chapter, if the words be rightly vnderſtood, they make nothing to their purpoſe: for certainely the minde ſeruing God, is the part of man that is ſpirituall and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regenerate: the mind being not regenerate, but in the naturall ſtate and condition, it is defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>and cannot ſerue God.</hi> And therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I my ſolfe in my mind ſerue the Law of God,</hi> he meanes, in his mind regenerate, and renued by grace: and the minde is put for the whole <hi>Inner man,</hi> and for his regenerate part throughout, and ſo it ſtill remaynes a true note of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles regeneration, that hee here ſpeakes of his <hi>Inner man,</hi> and it is a true note to others, that they alſo are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regenerate, if they be able to ſpeake it in truth, that they haue in them <hi>an Inner man,</hi> or new man, and that
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:422:210"/> now they are ſo wrought on by the Spirit of grace, as that they find themſelues altered and changed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that the Image of God in ſome meaſure is ſet on all the powers of their ſoules, and on all the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their bodies, and that now <hi>they are new creatures in Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. That is a true note of their Regeneration: and let that ſerue for anſwere to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection propounded.</p>
               <p>Now further, in that the Apoſtle here ſpeaking of his regenerate part, ſets it forth in theſe termes, and cals his regenerate part throughout both in ſoule and body, his <hi>Inner man,</hi> and that for the reaſon which before I gaue, becauſe Regeneration is chiefly ſeated in the heart and mind, and in the inward powers &amp; faculties of the ſoule: hence we may take vp this concluſion,</p>
               <p>That true Regeneration is chiefly ſeated in the heart and in the mind: <label type="milestone">

Wee muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to ſtocke vp the roote of ſinne, and to finde the worke of grace chiefly in our hearts and minds, if we would haue true comfort in the worke of grace in our ſelues: and the reaſon of it may be theſe.</p>

               <p>And therefore for the vſe of this. <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is no ground of true comfort.</note> thinke not to finde true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thine owne ſoule, only becauſe thy outward man is in ſome meaſure reformed, and thy hands, eyes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward parts of the bodie are reformed, and that in reſpect of thy outward carriage thou walkeſt vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and without repoofe. Alas, this thou maiſt doe, and yet want the power of grace in thy heart and minde; yea, this thou maiſt doe, and yet bee ignorant of God, and of the wayes of God, and be yet a man or woman of an vnreformed heart. We ſee it in common experience,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:422:211"/> that ſome that are groſſely ignorant, yet walke vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in reſpect of the World, they deale iuſtly and truely with euery one, yea, and they performe ſome outward duties of Pietie and Religion, and an Hypocrite, one that is rotten at the heart, and carries in him an heart full of wicked and noyſome luſts, of Pride, Enuie, Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and the like, may make a goodly ſhew, and may ſeeme to be religious, yea, he may carrie himſelfe ſo religiouſly in reſpect of his outward carriage, as that they that are truly religious, &amp; conuerſe with him, cannot diſcerne him, but may be deceiued by him. Thus did <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> he carryed himſelfe ſo ſmoothly as the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles could not diſcerne him, no, when Chriſt ſaid, One of them ſhould betray him, they could not preſently point at <hi>Iudas,</hi> and ſay he was the man. No, no, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Iudas</hi> had behaued himſelfe as religiouſly in ſhew, as the beſt of them, yet was he a notable Hypocrite, he had a rotten heart within him, and a bitter root of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was in his heart: and therefore reſt not in this, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art, that thou art outwardly reformed; that will deceiue thee if thou reſt in it. If thou wouldſt haue true comfort in the worke of grace in thy ſelfe, labour to finde it powerfull in thy heart and in thy minde princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, and to this purpoſe conſider, that if grace bee not powerfull and working ſpecially in thine heart, in time of tryall it will deceiue thee, and the Lord will at one time or other diſcouer thee and lay thee open to thy ſhame. And hence it is, that many fall away from the profeſſion they haue made in former time, and returne with the Dogge to his vomit, and the Sow to her tumbling in the myre, becauſe indeed they were neuer ſound at the root: grace was neuer powerfull in their hearts. Oh then, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this, and neuer reſt till thou finde it in thy ſelfe, euen grace working eſpecially in thine heart and minde, neuer reſt till thou finde thy minde truely inlightened, and thine heart truely reformed, and that thou makeſt
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:422:211"/> conſcience of thy very thoughts, and that thine heart is vpright with God, though thou haue many faylings; and that indeed will yeeld thee true comfort both in life and death.</p>
               <p>One thing yet remaines to bee noted; in that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here cals his regenerate part his <hi>Inner man,</hi> and giues to it the title of a whole man, not a piece or part of a man; but as it were an entire and whole man. Hence we are further taught,</p>
               <p>That true Regeration is entyre, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> it ſpreads it ſelfe ouer the whole man, euen ouer all the powers of the ſoule,
<note place="margin">True Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, ſpreading it ſelfe ouer the whole man.</note> and ouer all the parts and members of the bodie, and where ſanctifying grace is truely wrought, it is not found in one power or facultie of the ſoule, and not in anoher, but it is found in a proportionable meaſure in euery power and facultie of the ſoule, and in euery part and member of the bodie: for why? The Spirit of GOD neuer workes in any man or woman, but he goes thorow ſtitch with his worke, hee workes throughout; if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the minde with ſauing knowledge, he alſo works on the will, and on the affections in like proportion, and in all other faculties of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that regeneration is called a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt,</hi>

                  <hi>let him be a new creature: and a new birth, Tit.</hi> 3.5. and therefore it muſt needes be entyre, and of the whole man; for doubtleſſe the Spirit of God brings not forth a monſtrous birth, all head and nothing elſe, but hee brings forth a perfect birth, I meane, perfect in reſpect of all the parts, and where hee ſanctifies, <hi>hee ſanctifies throughout,</hi> as the Apoſtle prayed, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>in Spirit, in ſoule and in bodie.</hi>

                  </label> let no man thinke he is truly regenerate, becauſe haply he is enlightened,
<note place="margin">Illumination is not ſufficient to prooue true Regeneration.</note> and becauſe he hath in him ſome knowledge of God and of good things, and is able to ſpeake of ſuch things, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:422:212"/> yet notwithſtanding his heart is not reformed, but hee nouriſheth in his heart ſome corrupt luſt, or ſome inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection of Pride, of Enuie, of Couetouſneſſe or the like: if any ſo thinke, he deceiues himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> knew much, and did many good things: yet he was a meere carnall man, poſſeſſed with an inordinate loue of his Brothers Wife.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle hauing ſaid in the Verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that hee delighted in the Law of God, concerning the <hi>Inner man,</hi> and as he was renewed by grace: here hee makes knowne how it was with him, in reſpect of the remainder of ſinne that ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in him (namely) thus, that there was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie betweene that remainder of ſinne, and the Grace of Regeneration that was in him. And firſt, hee ſets
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:422:212"/> downe the meaſure of that enmitie, as that ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in him, reſiſted and rebelled againſt the grace that was wrought in him, it did violently reſiſt it as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell his Prince. And he amplifies that by his owne ſence, feeling and ſight of it, that he ſaw it ſo to be; hee ſaith, <hi>I ſee another law in my members rebelling againſt the Law of my minde.</hi> And then, ſecondly, hee makes knowne the iſſue and ſucceſſe of that reſiſtance and that rebelling of ſinne, which was this, That it led him captiue to ſinne, and brought him vnder the power of ſinne, in the words following: <hi>leading me captiue vnto the law of ſinne, which is in my members.</hi> Thus wee haue the ſeuerall parts of this Verſe, and the generall matter of it.</p>
               <p>Now for the firſt part of this Verſe in theſe words: <hi>I ſee another law in my members, rebelling againſt the Law of my minde.</hi> I will ſtand awhile to cleere the wordes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſence and meaning of them: <hi>But I ſee another law in my members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſee.</hi> The word ſignifieth, I behold, or looke on.
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> The meaning is, I plainly ſee and perceiue, and I diſcerne <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law in my members.</hi> The word <hi>(Law)</hi> is here put as before, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> to ſignifie the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, and not that barely, but the power, and force, and ſtrength of it, hauing in it the power and force of a Law, as it were ruling, gouerning and commanding. As if he had ſaid, I ſee another power, euen the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, which is as a Law that commandeth in my members. Some would haue the word <hi>(members)</hi> here to ſignifie only the parts and members of the bodie, but (as I take it) we are thereby to vnderſtand the ſame the Apoſtle ſpake of before, <hi>Verſ</hi> 18. vnder the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> namely, the vnregenerate part throughout, both in the powers of the ſoule, and in the parts and members of the bodie. And the vnregenerate part is thus called <hi>fleſh, or members,</hi> becauſe when the corruption of nature breakes out, and brings forth the effects and curſed
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:422:213"/> fruits of it, it is ſeene and perceiued rather in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts and members of the bodie, then in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward powers and faculties of the ſoule: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 19. <hi>Let no ſinne raigne therefore in your mortall bodie, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Neither giue your members ſeruants to vncleaneneſſe and to iniquitie, to commit iniquitie, but giue your members ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnto righteouſneſſe in holineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Rebelling.)</hi> The word here rendred rebelling, is meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall, it is borrowed and taken from ſuch as openly rebell againſt their lawfull Prince and Soueraigne, and take Weapons and beare Armes, and wage Warre againſt him, and ſtand at open defiance with him; and it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not a weake, or ſecret, or vnder-hand reſiſting, but as it were an open and a violent oppoſing, euen a ſtrong and powerfull withſtanding and ſtriuing againſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law of my mind.</hi> The word <hi>Law</hi> is here againe put by way of ſimilitude, for the power and force of grace in the minde; and by <hi>(minde)</hi> wee are to vnderſtand the minde regenerate and renewed by grace; and by a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechdoche,</hi> that is put for the whole <hi>Inner man,</hi> and for the regenerate part throughout, both in ſoule and in bodie; becauſe here the minde is oppoſed to the members, or to the fleſh, by which the regenerate part is ſignified: and ſo by <hi>the Law of the minde,</hi> is here meant the power of grace, as a Law commanding in the regenerate part.</p>
               <p>Thus then conceiue wee the Apoſtles meaning, when hee ſaith, <hi>But I ſee another law in my members, rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of my minde,</hi> as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I plainely ſee, and well perceiue, and I diſcerne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power and force, I meane, the corruption of my nature, that ſtill in part abides in me, which is as a law that commands in that part of me that is vnregenerate; I ſee, and I diſcerne, that mightily, violently, and ſtrongly oppoſing, and ſtriuing againſt the power of grace, that is in my whole Inner man, euen the power of grace, which is as a Law that commands
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:422:213"/> to the contrarie in that part of mee that is truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt, in that the Apoſtle hauing ſaid in the Verſe before, that he delighted in the Law of God concerning the <hi>inner man,</hi> hee preſently ſubioynes to it in this Verſe, <hi>but I ſee another law in my members, rebelling againſt the Law of my minde.</hi> As if he had ſaid, But I ſee there is reſiſtance, there is oppoſition made againſt that delight of mine, by the remainder of ſinne ſtill abiding in mee. Hence note we in a word the point was ſtood on before,</p>
               <p>That Gods children haue their delight they take in the Word of God, and in good things, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label>
                  <note place="margin">The delight that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren finde in good things, is many times croſſed and hindred.</note> many times croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and hindred, &amp; beſides outward things, as the world and wicked men, and the like oppoſing them, in reſpect of their loue and liking of good things, and their delight in them, they haue the remainder of ſinne ſtill abiding in them, to croſſe them, and to oppoſe againſt them: and when they finde ſweetneſſe and delight in good things, their owne corruption is ready to quaſh and quell that delight of theirs: becauſe indeed (as heretofore I haue ſhewed) corruption of nature ſtill abiding in them, is ſtirring and working, and one worke of it is to defile and repreſſe the good motions of the minde, and the worke of grace that is in them.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that no ſooner doth a childe of God finde delight in good things, but his owne corruption makes reſiſtance and oppoſition againſt that delight of his, and ſeekes to hinder it, &amp; to ſhake it out of his heart. And therefore know this, whoſoeuer thou art, that thou canſt not looke alwayes to finde the like meaſure of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in good things; thy delight in good things will be ſometimes greater, and ſometimes leſſe, for why? thine owne corruption makes reſiſtance, and ſtands in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt that delight of thine, and thou ſhalt finde it will ſometimes hinder it, and weaken it, and leſſen it in the meaſure: and therefore when thou findeſt in thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:422:214"/> meaſure of delight in good things, make much of it, cherriſh it, and labour to keepe it in thine heart, and to that purpoſe doe theſe two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">The leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of delight in good things is to be cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, how.</note> eſteeme of good things according to the worth and excellency of them, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>Iob</hi> 23.12. <hi>I haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the words of his mouth, more then mine appointed food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, eſtabliſh thy delight by counſell, as it is <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.18. I meane, by taking counſell with God: goe to the Lord by prayer, bee earneſt and inſtant with him to helpe and aſſiſt thee by his grace, that thou maiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue delighting in good things.</p>
               <p>And if thou doe theſe two things, doubtleſſe thou ſhalt be able to keepe thine heart in ſome good meaſure, delighting in good things, yea, thou ſhalt finde thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thoſe things much increaſed.</p>
               <p>Obſerue wee in the next place, that the Apoſtle doth not barely affirme this, that there was a law in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers rebelling againſt the Law of his minde, but hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes it as a thing ſeene and diſcerned, and plainely perceiued by him. <hi>I ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>another law in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers rebelling againſt the Law of my mind:</hi> I plainely ſee it, and I well perceiue it.

And hence it is, that the people of God, and the children of God, many times complaine of the rebellion of their owne hearts, and of the vileneſſe of their corrupt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:422:214"/> nature; which they would neuer doe, if they had not a liuely ſence and feeling of it, and if they did not cleerely ſee it, and diſcerne it. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.17. The Prophet, in the behalfe of the people, complaines of blindneſſe of minde and hardneſſe of heart; <hi>O Lord,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why haſt thou made vs to erre from thy wayes, and hardened our heart from thy feare?</hi> And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6. <hi>We haue all beene as an vncleane thing, and all our righteouſneſſe is as filthy cloutes.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Dauid</hi> cries out, <hi>Create in mee a cleane heart, O God, and renne a right Spirit within me.</hi> Which hee would not haue done, but that hee ſaw and diſcerned in him an vncleane heart, and a crooked ſpirit. And thus indeed it is with all Gods children, they are well acquainted with the rebellion of their owne hearts, they plainely ſee, and perceiue, and feele the ſtrong working of ſinne in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and they diſcerne the violent oppoſition that it makes againſt that grace that is in them; Gods children painely ſee vnbeliefe and doubting oppoſing their faith, ignorance and erronious conceits ſtanding vp againſt their ſound knowledge, hardneſſe, and dulneſſe, &amp; dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Spirit, ſtanding againſt their delight and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in good things and the like: And the reaſon of it is this,</p>

                  <note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature hath great force in Gods children, in their vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part.</note> ſo long as they liue in this world, but it hath alſo great force in them; it is as a Law that rules, and gouernes, &amp; commands in that part of them that is yet vnregenerate, and ſo farre foorth as Gods children be vnregenerate, the remainder of ſinne doth exerciſe a kinde of authoritie in all the powers of their ſoules, and in all the parts and members of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and it is as a Law that commands and requires o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to be giuen vnto it; the corruption of nature remaining in Gods children, is no weake and feeble thing, but it is a thing that is ſtrong and powerfull in the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:422:216"/> beſt of them, in their vnregenerate part. And hence it is, that the corruption of nature that abides in true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and in ſuch as are truely regenerate, is ſtill called <hi>The old man,</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Put off the old man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking to the Saints.

               <p>And hence likewiſe it was, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Romanes, of whom he was perſwaded that they were dead to ſinne, and quickned by grace to newneſſe of life,

And to theſe, many other teſtimonies might be added, confirming this truth: That the corruption of nature doth not only remaine in Gods children in part, whileſt they liue in this world, but it is as a Law that rules, and gouernes, and commands in the beſt of them, in their vnregenerate part, and ſo farre forth as they be vnregenerate: yea, doubtleſſe, Gods children finde it ſo in their owne experience, that the corruption of nature that ſtill abides in them in part, ſomtimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in their vnderſtanding, ſometimes in their will and affections, ſometimes in the parts and members of their bodies, yea, ſometimes they are ouercarried by it to ſome foule ſinne.</p>

               <p>Now the reaſon and ground of it is this: <label type="milestone">

                  </label> In their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part, and ſo farre foorth as they be vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, there is nothing to withſtand the power and force of their naturall corruption, the vnregenerate part hath no grace in it to withſtand that corruption, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in the naturall force and ſtrength of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needes bee ſtrong and powerfull, and as a law ruling and commanding in the vnregenerate part.</p>
               <p>And this being a truth; firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> it ſerues further to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that which heretofore I haue made knowne,
<note place="margin">The beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are imperfectly good.</note> and will now only remember in a word, namely this, that the beſt actions of the regenerate are imperfectly good, and they come ſhort of that perfection that ought to bee in them: for why? The moſt holy and moſt regenerate that liue in the world, are throughout in part vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and ſo farre forth as they be vnregenerate, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their owne hearts hath the command of them, it rules, and gouernes, and commands as a Law in that part of them that is yet vnregenerate, and that being throughout, it cannot poſſibly bee that their beſt works ſhould be perfect.</p>
               <p>Againe, is it ſo, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> that the corruption of nature doth not onely remaine in Gods children in part,

Is it thus with Gods children, and ſuch as are truely regenerate? How then, I beſeech you, is it with vnregenerate perſons, and with them that are yet in their naturall ſtate? Surely it muſt needes bee, that the corruption of nature, as a law, rules, and gouernes, and commands in them altogether; in them there is no dramme of ſanctifying grace, there is nothing but fleſh in them; and therefore they are wholly and throughout ruled, and gouerned, and commanded by the corruption of their owne hearts; and that is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition: yet ſo it is with euery vnregenerate
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:422:217"/> perſon, his owne corruption hath the whole command of him, and his owne luſts are as lawes vnto him, and the holy Ghoſt makes it knowne ſo to bee in the Booke of God. We read <hi>Iob</hi> 21.14. <hi>Iob</hi> brings in the wicked, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to God, <hi>Depart from vs: wee deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy wayes.</hi> And <hi>Ierem.</hi> 6.16. the Prophet brings in the Lord, ſaying thus to his people, <hi>Stand in the waies, and behold, and aske for the old way, which is the good way, and walke therein, and yee ſhall finde reſt for your ſoules.</hi> And he preſently ſubioynes the anſwere of the people, <hi>We will not walke therein.</hi> Now we may not thinke, that they were ſo forlorne, and ſo ſhameleſſe, as that they durſt thus ſpeake with their mouthes; but the meaning is, that thus they ſpake in their hearts, &amp; their affections ſpoke thus, in that they purpoſed with themſelues to caſt off the yoke of the Lord, and to liue after their owne luſts. And doe not wee finde it in wofull experience, that many caſt off the Word of God, and the wayes of God, and they will not bee guided by the will of God made knowne vnto them? Yea, ſome ſticke not to ſpeake it, that they will follow their owne wayes, and will do what ſeemes good to themſelues, ſay the Preachers what they will or can to the contrary. And what is this but a plaine euidence, that their owne corruption hath the whole command of them, and that their owne luſts are as lawes to them, and haue the command of them altogether? and that is a fearefull condition.</p>
               <p>And take notice of it, whoſoeuer thou art, that art yet in thy naturall ſtate and condition; Haſt thou no euidence of ſanctifying grace in thy heart? Doſt thou not finde and feele the power and the worke of the Spirit in thy ſoule in any meaſure?

               <p>Now further obſerue we, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that remainder of ſinne that dwelt in him, was as a law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in his members: <hi>I ſee another law in my members:</hi> meaning, as I ſhewed, his vnregenerate part throughout, which is expreſſed vnder the word <hi>(members,)</hi> becauſe when the corruption of nature breakes out, and brings foorth the fruits of it, it is rather ſeene in the parts and members of the body, then in the powers and faculties of the ſoule.

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:422:220"/> that is in them, and it makes not a weake and feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but a mighty, ſtrong, and violent oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and the luſts that ariſe thence, doe mightily warre and rebell againſt the working, and the fruits of grace, as vnbeliefe againſt faith, ignorance againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, deſpaire againſt hope, hypocriſie againſt ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, pride againſt humilitie, and ſo in other particulars.</p>

               <p>Thus muſt Gods children deale with the rebellious luſts of their owne hearts: Doſt thou find in thee the luſt of Pride, of Enuy, of Couetouſneſſe, of Vncleanneſſe, or any other ſinfull luſt riſing vp and rebelling againſt that power of grace that is in thee?

               <p>Wee are further to marke, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The law in his members rebelled againſt the Law of his minde.</hi> The remainder of ſinne that ſtill abode in him, warred and fought againſt the power of grace that was in him, and ſo the fight and warre that was in him, was betweene corruption and grace. And thus indeed it is in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and ſuch as are truely regenerate; there is in them a ſtrong fight and bitter combate betweene cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and grace; the fleſh and the Spirit are at conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warre and enmitie, and they fight and ſtriue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other in the Children of God, that is the fight and combate that is in them.

<note place="margin">How wee may know, that the combate that is in vs, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene grace &amp; corruption.</note> and the affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelues: becauſe they are partly ſpirituall, and partly carnall: and thou ſhalt know that this combate is in thee by this eſpecially: If thou find thine heart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried againſt it ſelfe, euen againſt it owne liking, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thy beſt-pleaſing ſinne; if thou finde in thy ſelfe a true diſlike and a lothing of that ſinne thou waſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to by nature; that is a ſure note, that there is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace in thy heart; and by this try thy ſelfe.</p>

<note place="margin">That opinion of the Papiſts, that men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue faith ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace in them, or no, confuted.</note> when they are preſſed with it, that a true Beleeuer may be aſſured of his owne ſaluation, by the teſtimonie of the Spirit of grace in his heart: becauſe <hi>as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſonnes of God, Rom.</hi> 8.14.

               <p>And take this for a certaine truth, that according to the meaſure of ſanctifying grace in any man or woman, ſo is the meaſure of their willingneſſe and readineſſe in doing good things. If thou wilt doe no more good then thou art compelled to doe; for example: If thou wilt not keepe the Sabbath, and ſanctifie it further then thou art compelled by mans Law, thou art but a formall Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. And ſo for euill things: If thou wilt abſtaine from
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:422:225"/> euill, no further then thou art reſtrayned by the Lawes of men, as it is with the moſt, when they are told of Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Rayling, Sabbath-breaking: Oh, ſay they, I hope it is no hanging matter, it is neither Felony nor Treaſon; and therefore they make no bones of it. If it be thus with thee, thou art but a graceleſſe Wretch, whoſoeuer thou art: thou haſt no dramme of ſanctifying grace in thee. Gods Children will not breake the Sabbath: and why? Grace ouer-rules them, and is as a Law to them, yea, according to the meaſure of grace that is in them, they willingly keepe the Sabbath, and yeeld obedience to God in all his Commandements.</p>
               <p>And hereby try thy ſelfe; If thou haue ſanctifying grace in thee, thou art readie and willing to doe good things, thou art not haled and drawne to doe good, but thou doeſt it willingly and of a readie minde, and from thy willingneſſe to doe good things, thou mayſt gather and conclude, that thou haſt ſanctifying grace in thine heart: and by this try thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now here a cauill of the Anabaptiſts is to bee met withall: ſay they,

               <p>Come we now to the ſecond part of this Verſe, in the words following: <hi>And leading mee captiue to the Law of ſinne, which is in my members.</hi> In theſe words, our Apoſtle makes knowne to vs the iſſue &amp; ſucceſſe of the reſiſtance and rebelling of the remaynder of ſinne, that ſtill abode in him, againſt the power of grace that was in him, as, namely, that the ſucceſſe of it was this: That hee was thereby brought vnder the power of ſinne, and made to yeeld to ſinne: which the Apoſtle (ſtill continuing his former Metaphor and ſimilitude, taken from warre or fighting) deliuers vnder theſe termes, that <hi>he was led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to ſinne:</hi> and he ſets downe the power of ſinne as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vnder the word <hi>Law. Leading me captiue to the Law of ſinne.</hi> And that is further amplified by the ſubiect of it, <hi>in his members, and leading me captiue to the Law of ſinne which is in my members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs a little examine theſe words, that wee may find out the true ſenſe and meaning of them,
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> 
                  <hi>And leading mee captiue,</hi> in this word: for it is but one word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, or in this Phraſe and forme of ſpeech, <hi>(Leading captiue.)</hi> The Apoſtle alludes to the manner of great and mighty Conquerors in warre, ſuch as haue gotten the victory ouer their enemies, and are wont to leade them whom they haue taken aliue, as priſoners faſt bound and tyed, and to keepe them vnder their power as Vaſſals and Slaues.</p>
               <p>To this the Apoſtle here hath reſpect, and his meaning is, that ſinne riſing vp in rebellion againſt the power of grace that was in him, and warring and fighting againſt it, ſometimes it preuayled againſt grace, and ſometimes it ouercame him, and as it were tooke him priſoner, and carryed him away like a captiue, and as a vanquiſhed man <hi>(to the Law of ſinne.)</hi> The word <hi>(Law)</hi> is here put, as before, to ſignifie the power of ſinne, and by <hi>ſinne,</hi> wee are to vnderſtand the corruption of nature, euen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynder of ſinne that ſtill abode in the Apoſtle, together
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:422:226"/> with the euill motions and luſts ariſing from thence. And therefore he addes, <hi>which is in my members:</hi> or as it is in the Originall, <hi>which hath exiſtence and being in my members.</hi> As if he had ſaid, To the force and to the power of ſinne which hath an actuall being in my members, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill motions and luſts of it. By <hi>(Members)</hi> wee are to vnderſtand, as before, all the powers of the ſoule, and all the parts and members of the body.</p>
               <p>Thus then conceiue wee the meaning of theſe words, <hi>And leading me captiue to the Law of ſinne which is in my members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>And ſometimes preuayling againſt that grace that is in me, and ouercomming me, and by the ſtrength of it getting victory ouer me, and carrying me as a captiue, and as a vanquiſhed man, and bringing mee vnder the force and power of that corruption that ſtill in part abides in mee, and to the power of the euill motions and luſts of it, which luſts haue their actuall being in all the powers of my ſoule, and in all the parts and members of my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we to the matter of obſeruation and doctrine; and firſt, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, The remainder of ſinne that ſtill abode in him, rebelled, fought and warred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of grace that was in him, and ſometimes preuayled againſt it, and led him as a captiue, &amp; brought him vnder the power of ſinne. <label type="milestone">

               <p>We are to take notice how it is with the beſt of Gods children ſometimes, namely thus:
<note place="margin">Though the remaynder of ſinne ſtill abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Gods children, doe not for euer and wholly ouercome the grace that is in them, yet ſometimes in part and for a time it gets victorie ouer it</note>
               </p>
               <p>That the beſt of Gods children, the moſt holy, and the moſt regenerate that liue in the world, haue not onely ſinne in part abiding in them, and fighting, and warring againſt that power of grace that is in them, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preuayling againſt that grace, and getting the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of it; ſinne that abides in Gods children in part, though it doe not for euer, and wholly ouercome the grace that is in them, that is not poſſible, yet ſometimes in part and for a time, it gets the victorie ouer it, &amp; doth
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:422:227"/> conquer it, and as it were leades away a child of God, as a captiue vnder the power of it. We reade, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. that in the battell that was betweene <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Amalek, While</hi> MOSES <hi>held vp his hand,</hi> ISRAEL <hi>preuailed,</hi> but when he let his hand <hi>downe,</hi> AMALEK <hi>preuailed:</hi> So it is in the fight and combat betweene Grace and Sinne in Gods children: the victorie and conqueſt is ſometimes on one part, and ſometimes on the other; ſometimes Grace is too ſtrong for ſinne, and beares downe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, and keeps them vnder: and ſometimes againe Sinne is too ſtrong for Grace, and beares it down in part for a time, and ſo farre preuailes ouer it, as ſometimes it carryes a child of God as a captiue to it, and to the luſts of it, and by the ſtrength of it drawes him to the doing of ſome euill.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe wee haue many examples in the Booke of God, as of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and others. And doubtleſſe, Gods children are able to witneſſe this to be a truth, out of their owne experience, though it be to their griefe. Yea, if we obſerue it, we ſhall find, that ſinne abiding in Gods children, hath ſometimes ſtrangely preuailed ouer the power of grace that was in them, and ſtrangely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed them, yea, the very beſt of them: as, haue they not beene ſtrangely ouer-carryed and led away by their owne corruption, when they haue caſt forth doubtfull ſpeeches, touching Gods grace &amp; fauour towards them, as if God had forſaken them, and quite caſt them out of his ſight, and ſhut vp his loue from them, and reckoned them as enemies?</p>
               <p>Thus it was with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 77.7, 8, 9. <hi>Will the Lord abſent himſelfe for euer? and will he ſhew no more fauour? Is his morcy cleane gone for euer? Doth his promiſe faile for enormore? Hath God forgotten to be mercifull? Hath he ſhut vp his tender mercies in diſpleaſure?</hi> And was not <hi>Iob,</hi> that deare ſeruant and child of God, ſtrangely ouer-carryed
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:422:227"/> by the ſtrength of his owne corruption, when hee curſed the time and moneths of his life? <hi>Iob</hi> 3.3, to 12. And the like did the holy Prophet <hi>Ieremiah, Ierem.</hi> 20.14, 15. <hi>Curſed be the day wherein I was borne, and let not the day wherein my mother bare mee, be bleſſed.</hi> And <hi>Ierom.</hi> 12.1. he reaſons the caſe with God, as if the Lord were not righteous in his adminiſtration and gouernement of the world, becauſe of the great proſperity of the wicked. And thus did <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 73.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Thus haue theſe holy ſeruants and children of God beene ſtrangely ouer-carryed by the ſtrength of their owne corruption; and it plainly proues the point in hand, That ſinne that abides in Gods children in part, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preuailes ouer that grace that is in them, and ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomes it, and conquers it, and ſo ſometimes it leades them away vnder the power of it, to the acting of ſome euill. And the reaſon of it is this,</p>
               <p>The grace that is in Gods children, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now the Lord is pleaſed ſomtimes for cauſes knowne to himſelfe, a little to with-draw his aſſiſting hand from that grace that is in Gods children: and thence it is that ſometimes ſinne that abides in them, preuailes ouer it, <label type="milestone">

It is a comfort to a man that is falne into ſome grieuous diſeaſe, when he heares that others haue bene ſicke of the ſame diſeaſe, and yet haue recouered. So let it cheere thee vp, when thou art ſometimes led as a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue againſt thy purpoſe, to the doing of ſome euill, that thy betters haue bene ſo, and yet haue done well, and were ſtill the children of God.

               </p>
               <p>That there is a plaine difference betweene the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and the vnregenerate,
<note place="margin">The difference betweene the regenerate &amp; vnregenerate, in regard of their captiuity to ſinne.</note> in reſpect of their captiuity to ſinne, as (namely) thus: Such as are truly regenerate, are ſometimes in part captiued, and brought vnder the power of their owne corruption; but it is vnwillingly, and their captiuity vnder the power of ſinne is forced,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:422:230"/> and it is with a feeling of their bondage, and an earneſt deſire to be freed from their captiuity: but it is farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with vnregenerate perſons, they freely and with full conſent of will, put themſelues vnder the power of their owne vile luſts, and their captiuity vnder ſinne is voluntary, and they haue no feeling of their bondage: no, they ſuſpect it not, much leſſe do they truly deſire li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedome from it.</p>
               <p>We know, that a Prince will not willingly be led away captiue of a Rebell; and if he be taken by the hands of a Rebell, it is againſt his will, and he is neuer well, till he be freed: but a baſe fellow, one of meane condition, and a debaſhed wretch, of wretched life and conuerſation, he will eaſily ioyne hands with a Rebell, and willingly ſuffer himſelfe to be led by him to the ſame Rebellion, and take pleaſure in it: ſo is it in this caſe; one that is borne anew of the Spirit, will not willingly be led away as a captiue by his rebelling fleſh, and if ſometimes he bee ſurpriſed, and ouercome by the luſts of it, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will, and he deſires to be freed from that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity, yea, he takes any oportunitie that is offered, to be freed from it, as <hi>Peter</hi> did on the crowing of the Cocke, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.75. and on Chriſt his looking back on him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.61. &amp; as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, ſo ſoone as euer the Lord ſent the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> to him, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, one that is wholy carnall, and as yet in his baſe condition of nature, he willingly puts forth his hand to ſinne, and he yeeldes to the euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſts of his owne heart, and is led by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, yea, he takes pleaſure in them, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith of the Gentiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. <hi>He giues himſelfe to worke wickednes, euen with greedines, he drinkes iniquitie like water, Iob</hi> 15.16. <hi>and drawes ſinne, as with a cartrope, Iſaiah</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>Thus ſtandes the difference betweene the regenerate and the vnregenerate, in reſpect of their captiuity to ſin:
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:422:231"/> The regenerate, they are ſomtimes taken and led as cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues vnder the power of their owne corruption, but it is vnwillingly, and they are weary of that bondage: But vnregenerate perſons, they make themſelues vaſſalls and ſlaues to the luſts of their owne hearts, and they yeeld to them with full conſent of will, and they willingly fight vnder the banner of ſinne and Satan, againſt God and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Word: and the ground of this difference is this:</p>
               <p>Becauſe there is grace in the one, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> and none in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the regenerate haue in them a meaſure of ſanctifying grace, and the vnregenerate haue none, they are wholly fleſh, and nothing but a lumpe of ſinne. Now then, to make vſe of this difference,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> this may ſerue to diſcouer vnto vs, who they be that ſinne of infirmitie,
<note place="margin">Who they be that may truly plead infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſinning.</note> who they be that may truly plead infirmitie in ſinning, and may truly ſay, It is of weakenes that ſometimes they fall into ſinne. Surely only the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and ſuch as are truly regenerate: for why? they only are led captiues vnder the power of ſinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, and they only are ſometimes ouercome of the luſts of their owne hearts, not becauſe they are willing to yeeld to them, but becauſe they are weake to reſiſt them, and are ſometimes ſurpriſed by the deceitfulnes of ſinne, and by the ſleights of Satan.</p>
               <p>Vnregenerate perſons cannot truly pleade infirmitie in ſinne, though indeed ſometimes the baſe Drunkard, and the moſt filthy perſon that liues in the world, will plead infirmitie, and ſay, Oh, his ſinne is his infirmitie, and you muſt beare with him, it is his infirmitie. Poore ſoules! They deceiue themſelues; can that be ſaid to be a ſinne of infirmitie, which they ruſh into with full conſent of will, and with much pleaſure giue themſelues vnto? No, no; if they ſo thinke, they deceiue themſelues: that is a ſinne of weakenes and infirmitie, when men purpoſe and reſolue againſt it, ſtriue againſt it, pray againſt it, and vſe
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:422:231"/> all good meanes to keepe them from it; and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ouer-carryed by the ſtrength of their own corruption, and doe ſometimes vnwillingly fall into it, and that is proper to the regenerate; and therefore let no vnregenerate perſon plead his infirmitie in ſinning.</p>
               <p>Againe, for a ſecond vſe: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Let the difference betweene the regenerate and the vnregenerate,

               <p>Hereby try thy ſelfe, whoſoeuer thou art, in what ſtate and condition thou art, whether in the ſtate of grace, or in the ſtate of nature.

Is it thus with thee? Surely, then thou mayſt hereupon conclude, to the comfort of thine owne ſoule, that thou art truely rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and in the ſtate of grace.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if ſo bee thou bee readie to put forth thine hand to ſin, and thou doeſt yeeld to the luſts of thine owne heart willingly, and takeſt pleaſure in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling them, and it is euen meate and drinke to thee to doe euill, yea, thou ruſheſt into ſinne, <hi>as a bard Horſe into the Battell, Ierem.</hi> 8.6. and thou art ſuch a one as Chriſt ſpeakes of, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. <hi>the luſts of the Deuill thou doeſt:</hi> for thy ſinfull luſts are his luſts, hee deſires thou ſhouldſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill them; thou doeſt euill things, and thou wilt doe them; as many there bee of that ſort, they doe wickedly, and they will do it, &amp; what hath any man to doe with them?

               <p>One thing yet remaines to bee noted. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>leading me captiue to the law of ſinne:</hi> (that is) to the power of ſinne, and the euill luſts riſing from thence.

               <p>Theſe words are diuerſly expounded. Some expound them thus, <hi>This mortall bodie ſubiect to death.</hi> As if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had deſired to be deliuered from his conflicts with
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:422:233"/> ſinne, by his bodily death. But (as I take it) that is not his purpoſe and meaning: but rather by the word <hi>Body,</hi> we are to vnderſtand the maſſe and lumpe of ſinne, ſtill in part abiding in the Apoſtle, whereof he complained. It is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall in Scripture, to ſtyle the corruption of nature, euen the whole maſſe or lumpe of ſinne, by the name and title of a body, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>That the bodie of ſinne might be deſtroyed;</hi> and in many other places. And it is called <hi>a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of death,</hi> becauſe it is a deadly thing in it ſelfe, and makes vs liable to death; without Gods mercy, to death temporall, and to death eternall: and therefore it is called <hi>a body of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then conceiue the Apoſtles meaning in this Verſe, as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O poore tyred and wearied man that I am, I find my ſelfe in a miſerable caſe, being toyled and turmoyled with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conflicts, and ſtriuing with the relikes of ſinne that ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in me, and I long and greatly deſire deliuerance and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and I am not able to wind out my ſelfe by mine owne ſtrength: and therefore who ſhall deliuer me from that maſsie lumpe of ſinne, that ſtill in part abides in me, which is a deadly thing in it ſelfe, and of it ſelfe makes me liable to death, euen death temporall and death eternall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now firſt, in that the Apoſtle out of the ſence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſinne in himſelfe, rebelling againſt the power of grace that was in him, and ſometimes leading him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the law of ſinne, breakes out in this manner, and cryes out: O wretched or miſerable man, O poore tyred and wearied man that I am, how am I toyled and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyled with continuall conflicts and combates! we may eaſily gather and take vp this concluſion,</p>
               <p>That it is a miſerable thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> and makes men in ſome degree wretched and miſerable, in that they carrie about but the remainder of ſinne; in that they haue ſtill abiding in them but ſome relikes of their naturall corruption, and are troubled with the continuall aſſaults and force of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:422:234"/> that corruption;
<note place="margin">The deareſt of Gods children liuing in this world, are in ſome degree wretched, by reaſon of ſinne ſtill abiding in them in part, and ſtill rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the power of grace that is in them.</note> euen the deareſt of Gods children that liue on the face of the earth, are in ſome degree wretched, by reaſon of ſinne ſtill abiding in them in part, and ſtill rebelling againſt the power of grace that is in them, and by reaſon of the continuall conflicts they vndergoe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene grace and that corruption that ſtill remaines in them in part; though the corruption of nature be in part weakened and aboliſhed in Gods children, yet it is a wretched and weariſome thing to them, to carrie about them but the remnants of ſinne, and to haue that ſtirring in them.</p>
               <p>This (no doubt) was one cauſe, why the Apoſtle deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be diſſolued or looſed, and to be with Chriſt, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I deſire to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Though indeed the chiefe cauſe of his deſire was, that he might be with Chriſt, as himſelfe ſpeakes, and enioy the preſence of Chriſt, and the fulneſſe of ioy with him in Heauen, yet (no doubt) one cauſe of his deſire was, that he might be freed from his wretchedneſſe and weariſomeneſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the remainder of ſinne that ſtill abode in him: And that the remainder of ſinne makes Gods children in ſome degree wretched and miſerable, may eaſily appeare to vs, if we duly conſider the effects of it in the deareſt of Gods children liuing in this world: For why? Sinne ſtill remaining in Gods children in part, what doth it? Surely it defiles them in part, both within and without, it defiles them in part in all the powers of their ſoules, and in all the parts and members of their bodies; yea, it defiles their moſt holy &amp; beſt actions, it makes a blot and ſtaine cleaue to the beſt things they performe, and makes <hi>all their righteouſneſſe as a menstruous cloth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6. It makes them offend their good and gracious God and Father, whom they would not willingly offend, yet it makes them to offend him, by doing things contrary to his Will and Word; yea, it makes them many times <hi>grieue</hi> and make ſad <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi>

And therefore from theſe effects, as on ſo many grounds, we may reſolue on this as a certaine and cleare truth, that it is a miſerable thing, to carrie about but the relikes of ſinne, and it makes the beſt of Gods children in ſome degree wretched, in that they carrie about but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of ſinne. And this being a truth,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> it ſerues to confirme that Argument wee vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts,
<note place="margin">Our argument againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, prouing concupiſcence to be properly ſinne, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> to proue Concupiſcence to be truely and properly ſinne; which they denie. Wee argue thus from this Text: Concupiſcence makes men miſerable. Therefore it is truely and properly ſinne: for nothing but ſinne makes men miſerable. But to elude and put off this Argument, the Papiſts haue found out a ſhift: Say they, The word here vſed, doth not ſignifie one in diſgrace with God, and ſubiect to his heauie diſpleaſure: for that which makes men miſerable in that ſence, is ſinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſay they: But the word here ſignifies an vnhappie man, expoſed to the danger of ſinne, and to all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this world. Theſe be their words. A poore ſhift, and eaſily anſwered: For what is it that makes men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie, and expoſeth them to the miſeries of this world? Is it any thing elſe but ſinne? Certainely, nothing but ſinne makes men vnhappie, as forgiueneſſe of ſinnes makes happie, <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe wickedneſſe is forgiuen, and whoſe ſinne is couered, Pſal.</hi> 32.1. So ſinne makes wretched.</p>
               <p>Againe it is true, that the word here applyed to the Apoſtle, doth not ſignifie one in diſgrace with the Lord; but yet taken by it ſelfe, it hath that ſignification, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:422:235"/> plainely, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Weepe and howle for the miſeries that ſhall come vpon you.</hi> What miſeries? Surely, chiefely miſeries in the world to come. And therefore this is but a poore ſhift of the Papiſts, to elude our Argument. Now for vſe of the point to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> that it is a miſerable thing, to carrie about but the relikes of ſinne?
<note place="margin">The bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods children is here mixed with ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</note> And that the beſt of Gods children are in ſome degree wretched, in that they carrie about but the remainder of ſinne? Surely then, Gods children haue not a perfection of bleſſedneſſe in the time of this life, but their bleſſedneſſe here is mixed with ſome miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Though they be in an happie and bleſſed eſtate, and truly bleſſed in this life, hauing pardon of their ſinnes, aſſurance of Gods loue, the firſt fruits of the Spirit, and right and title to all the comforts of the Saints of God; yet their bleſſedneſſe here is with a mixture of ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, in that they carrie about the remainder of ſinne, and ſhall carrie it ſo long as they liue in this world; and that defiles their beſt actions, and makes them offend their good &amp; gracious God, and grieue his Spirit, and drawes on them many times the afflicting hand of God; and ſo their bleſſedneſſe here is but in part, and ſhal not be made perfect in reſpect of full freedome from ſinne, till their ſoules be remoued out of their bodies. And this ſhould make Gods children willingly embrace death, when it comes; death ſhould be welcome to them, becauſe that will ſet them at libertie, not onely from the miſeries of this world, but alſo from ſinne, the greateſt burden, griefe, and vexation to their ſoules all their life long, after their effectuall calling. In this reſpect therefore, when death comes, they are willingly to yeeld to it, and as it were with both hands to embrace it.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> is it ſo, that ſinne remaining but in part, makes men miſerable in ſome degree? How then doth ſinne raigning and domineering, make miſerable? And in what a miſerable caſe and condition are they, that
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:422:235"/> haue in them the whole body of ſinne, in the full force and ſtrength of it? Surely,
<note place="margin">Their miſerie is maruelous great and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, that haue ſinne raigning in them.</note> their miſerie muſt needes be exceeding great and intolerable; take wee but a ſhort view of it; they are miſerable within, without, and on euery ſide. For why? they are in bondage to Satan, and to the luſts of their owne hearts; they are led of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, at his will and pleaſure; they haue in them an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and guiltie conſcience, and that dogs them and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes them continually; and though it may be for a time benummed and aſleepe, yet at length it will awaken, and ſometimes they feele the flames of Hell flaſhing vp in their ſoules. The good things done by them, as hearing the Word, Praying, and the like, are not onely defiled with ſinne, but they are ſinnes, and abominable in Gods ſight; they are ſubiect to all the Plagues, Iudgements, and Curſes of God, denounced againſt ſinne and ſinners in this life, whereof we read <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.

For then they ſhall be ſeuered from the comfortable preſence of God, and from the glorious fellowſhip of Chriſt, and of his Angels &amp; Saints, and ſhall haue eternall fellowſhip with the Deuill and his Angels, and feele the whole wrath of God on them: It had been better for them to haue been made Toades, then men or women, liuing and dying in that ſtate and condition: for when the Toade dies, there is an end of the miſerie of it; but when they die, then begins their endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, and remedileſſe miſerie. And let all ſuch as are yet in their naturall ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and as yet liue in their ſinnes, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, conſider theſe things; and if Hell haue not taken full poſſeſſion of their ſoules, it will make them bethinke themſelues of ſpeedie reformation.</p>
               <p>Conſider we in the next place, that the Apoſtle brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out, and vttering this exclamation, <hi>O wretched man

The Apoſtle, without queſtion, had a liuely ſence and feeling of his miſerie, and held himſelfe in ſome degree wretched and miſerable, by reaſon of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſinne that was in him, continually fighting &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the power of grace that was in him: and thereupon it was, that he broke out, and cryed out, <hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi>

Gods children feele themſelues tyred and wearied, and as it were worne out with continuall tugging and ſtriuing againſt the corruption of their hearts, and nothing more troubles them and grieues them, and nothing doe they more complaine of, then the relikes of ſinne ſtill abiding in them, and drawing them from their ſound obedience to the will of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſometimes to doe euill.

               <p>Wee ſhall find, that Gods children haue beene able to

               <p>When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was troubled with temptations to ſinne, which Satan ſuggeſted to his mind, &amp; he felt his owne corruption ready to ſtirre him vp to pride, through the abundance of Reuelations, he eſteemed thoſe things as beatings and buffettings, and as prickes and thornes in his fleſh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, through the abundance of Reuelations, there was giuen me a pricke in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan, to buffet me, becauſe I ſhould not be exalted out of meaſure.

And thus (vndoubtedly) it is with all that haue the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Grace that <hi>Moſes</hi> had, euen with all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; they eſteeme ſinne ſtill abiding in them, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the power of grace in them, and ſometimes leading them captiue vnder the power of it, their greateſt miſerie, and that is the thing they grieue for, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of, aboue all things in the world.

               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> Gods children haue their eyes opened, and they ſee and well diſcerne, that ſinne ſtill abiding in them, and rebelling againſt the power of grace in them, is the cauſe of all other euils and troubles they vndergoe and endure; and that, were it not for ſinne ſtill remaining in them, they ſhould be free from all other miſeries in the world.</p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:422:237"/>
               <p>And againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Gods children are able to apprehend ſin ſtill abiding in them, and rebelling againſt the power of grace in them, and to take notice of it, in the true nature of it, and as it is indeed in it ſelfe (as namely) that it is vile and odious in Gods ſight, and diſpleaſing to God, and in it ſelfe, and of it ſelfe, makes them liable to the wrath of God, which no other miſerie in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides doth; their pouertie, their impriſonment, or any other miſerie they endure, deſerues not the wrath of God in it ſelfe and of it ſelfe; nay, they are as highly in Gods fauour in their pouertie, as in their wealth; in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as when they are at libertie. Indeed their carriage in other troubles and miſeries, may deſerue Gods anger and diſpleaſure: but the troubles and miſeries in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and of themſelues, do not, but ſinne that ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in them, that doth, in it ſelfe, and of it ſelfe, deſerue the wrath of God: and this, Gods children haue eyes to ſee, and they are able to apprehend and to take notice of.

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:422:238"/> for nothing but bodily euils; as becauſe haply they are blinde, or lame, or deafe, or they are impriſoned, or they are extreme poore, or the like: and ye ſhall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heare a worldly man or woman crie out, and ſay, Oh! neuer did any endure ſuch miſerie, as I haue, and do vndergoe!

               <p>Come we now to the laſt words of this Verſe, wherein the Apoſtle expreſſeth from what he would be deliuered, namely, from the body of this death. <hi>Who ſhall deliuer me,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the body of this death?</hi> that is, as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the maſſy lump of ſin ſtill abiding in me, which is deadly, and in it ſelfe deſerueth death of body, and death of ſoule.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For vſe, it meetes with a Popiſh error;
<note place="margin">That error of the Papiſts confuted, that peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, may be had by inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and by the merit of good workes.</note> it is held and taught by the Papiſts, that peace and quietnes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, euen towards God, may be had by inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and by the merit of good workes, that a man may haue his conſcience quieted and pacified in reſpect of Iuſtification, and freedome from guiltines of ſinne, by his owne inherent holines, and by the merit of his owne good workes. That is a groſſe error, and it cannot ſtand
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:422:248"/> with the Truth now deliuered. <hi>Luther</hi> reports, that hee in his time obſerued many Papiſts, that tooke great paines, and on meere conſcience did as much as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them, in Faſting, Prayer, and other exerciſes; and all to this end, that they might finde quietneſſe, and peace of conſcience; and yet the more they laboured, the more they were ſtricken downe with feare, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they came to the houre of death; then (ſaith he) I haue ſeene them exceeding fearefull, yea, I haue ſeene ſometimes Murtherers and others, executed as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Malefactors, dye more comfortably, then they did.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Luther</hi> obſerued in his time.

               <p>Againe, for a ſecond vſe: is it ſo, that in Chriſt alone is found eaſe, comfort and refreſhing to the weary ſoule, and to the poore diſtreſſed minde and conſcience?

               <p>Some there be that much complaine of their ſinfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and it is a good complaint; I doubt not but they are the deare Children of God that ſo complaine, and they ſay ſometimes, Oh, if I might come to ſuch a meaſure of faith, or ſuch a meaſure of truſt in God, or ſuch a meaſure of ioy and delight in good things, and ſuch like, I ſhould bee well, my minde would then bee at eaſe and quiet.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I grant, if thou hadſt that meaſure of faith, of truſt in God, and delight in good things thou deſireſt, it would yeeld thee much comfort, becauſe it would ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeale vp to thee thy being in Chriſt: yet thou muſt know, that ſtill thy comfort comes from Chriſt, <q>it is not the meaſure of thy faith, <label type="milestone">

And therefore reſt not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grace or goodneſſe in thy ſelfe, as the ground of thy comfort, though it may yeeld thee much comfort, in that it giues thee aſſurance that thou art in Chriſt; yet ſtill for the ground of thy comfort, goe out of thy ſelfe, and ſeeke for that in Chriſt alone: in him alone ſhalt thou find eaſe, comfort, reſt, and refreſhing to thy wearie ſoule.</p>
               <p>Note wee further, the Apoſtle hauing cryed out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer mee from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of this death!</hi> here hee cheeres vp himſelfe with this, that certainly in Chriſt he ſhould haue a full deliuerance from the power of ſinne.</p>

               <p>In the next place obſerue wee, that the Apoſtle here ſpeaking of his deliuerance from the power of ſinne, and from the guiltineſſe of ſinne through IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST, hee doth not barely affirme it, and ſpeake of it, but hee affirmes it, and ſpeakes of it with thankeſgiuing to God, hee ſaith not barely, Through Ieſus Chriſt I ſhall bee deliuered: but <hi>I thanke God, I bleſſe God, and I giue him thankes through Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> I ſhall haue deliuerance.

               <p>That as many as acknowledge Chriſt their Ieſus, muſt alſo acknowledge him to be their Lord, and muſt take his yoke on them. And therefore in vaine doe they hold Chriſt to be their Sauiour, and to haue borne the burden of their ſinnes, who neuer ſubmit their necks to his yoke. But of this we haue ſpoken heretofore; therefore I paſſe by it: onely note in a word,</p>
               <p>That Chriſt is the Lord of all true Beleeuers in ſpeciall manner, they being giuen to him of his Father, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">

The Anſwer to it is eaſie.</p>
               <p>It ſtands partly on a wrong tranſlation of ſome part of the Text.</p>

               <p>And againe, the Apoſtle ſaith not, the grace of God through Ieſus Chriſt; but, <hi>I thanke God, I giue thankes to God through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Hee being able to bleſſe God, and to giue him thankes, that in part hee was deliuered, and did certainly expect full deliuerance from the power of ſinne through Ieſus Chriſt, it is a plaine euidence, that he was a man truly regenerate, and in the ſtate of grace: for indeed, none but ſuch as be truly regenerate, and in the ſtate of grace, and none but ſuch as be in Chriſt, can bleſſe God for his mercie towards them, in reſpect of any good thing beſtowed on them, or any good thing that they expect or looke for, from the hands of God.

               <p>Come we now to the words following; <hi>Then I my ſelfe in my mind ſerue the Law of God, but in my fleſh the Law of Sinne.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle concludes his ſpeech touching the Spirituall Combat, briefely ſetting downe the ſumme and ſubſtance of it, ſtill giuing inſtance of it in his owne perſon, <hi>Then I my ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> The connexion of theſe words, with fore-going matter, is thus: The Apoſtle hauing cryed out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:422:253"/> ſhall deliuer me from the bodie of this death!</hi> and then chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp himſelfe with comfort in and through Chriſt: In theſe words hee concludes to his comfort, that hee was not wholly captiued to ſinne: but though his fleſh and corruption ſtill in part abiding in him, did much trouble him, yet in his minde he ſerued the Law of God. <hi>Then I my ſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in my mind ſerue the Law of God, but in my fleſh the law of ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here the Apoſtle inſiſting in his owne perſon, <hi>I my ſelfe,</hi> diuides himſelfe into two parts, <hi>minde and fleſh; In my minde, In my fleſh.</hi> And then hee makes knowne what he did in reſpect of theſe two parts, as, namely, that in his mind he ſerued the Law of God, and in his fleſh he ſerued the Law of ſinne. And ſo we ſee the dependance of theſe words on foregoing matter, and the generall matter and ſubſtance of them.</p>
               <p>Now a little for the vnderſtanding of theſe words:
<note place="margin">Interpretation</note> 
                  <hi>Then I my ſelfe,</hi> or, <hi>then,</hi> namely, <hi>I my ſelfe, euen I</hi> PAVL <hi>my ſelfe.</hi> It is ſtrange, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> that ſome ſhould thinke the Apoſtle ſpake in the perſon of another, when hee ſo expreſly ſets it down that he meant himſelfe <hi>(In my mind, In my fleſh.)</hi> The words <hi>(mind and fleſh)</hi> doe not here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Papiſts expound them, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſoule and body; for hee being truely regenerate, was thorowout regenerate both in his ſoule and in his body in part; But <hi>by mind</hi> we are to vnderſtand his mind renued by grace, that is put, by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> for his whole regenerate part thorowout, euen the ſame which before hee cals <hi>the Inner man, Verſ.</hi> 22. and which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> cals <hi>the hid man of the heart,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.</note> And ſo alſo by the word <hi>(fleſh)</hi> we are to vnderſtand his vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part thorowout both in body and ſoule, the corruption of nature abiding in him in part, in all the powers of his ſoule, and in all the parts and members of his body, which is vſually called by the name of fleſh in the Scripture.</p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:422:254"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serue the Law of God:</hi> that is, yeeld obedience to the Law of God, know it, delight in it, and doe the good things it requires: and by the Law of God is meant, as before I ſhewed, the morall Law of God, which makes knowne Gods will touching all good dueties both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and men. The law of ſinne, that is, the power of ſinne, the force and commanding power of that corruption that ſtill abides in me, and the euill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it: <hi>I yeeld to it, and am many times ouercarryed by it.</hi> Thus then briefly vnderſtand wee theſe words, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then namely I</hi> PAVL <hi>my ſelfe in mine owne perſon, in my regenerate part, and as I am regenerate, doe yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of God, which makes knowne the good will of God touching all good duties; I know it, and I delight in it, and I doe the good things it requires. But in my vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part, as I am vnregenerate, I yeeld to the commanding power of that corruption that ſtill abides in me, and the euill motions of it, and am many times ouercarryed by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt here we ſee, that the Apoſtle makes it cleere, that he ſpake of himſelfe, in ſetting forth the ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Some make queſtion and doubt of it, yea ſome haue flatly denyed it, that the Apoſtle in this diſcourſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirituall combate, meant himſelfe: but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle puts it here out of all queſtion, and directly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes it, that it was of himſelfe that he ſpake, and hee ſpake not here of himſelfe figuratiuely, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. but directly and plainly,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.</note> that <hi>he did not allow the euill which he did,</hi> that <hi>hee did the euill he hated,</hi> that <hi>hee did not the good which he would,</hi> that <hi>the Law in his members rebelled againſt the Law of his mind,</hi> and that <hi>in his mind he ſerued the Law of God, and in his fleſh the Law of ſinne.</hi> That theſe things he found in himſelfe. Hence then we are giuen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it is a true concluſion,</p>
               <p>That the beſt of Gods children, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> the moſt holy that liue on the face of the earth, many times doe the euil they

<note place="margin">Gods deareſt children li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in this world, many times doe the euill they hate, and doe not the good they would.</note> They are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſinfull infirmities, the power of ſinne rebels againſt the power of grace that is in them, and leades them captiue to the Law of ſinne. Wee haue here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle an excellent inſtrument of Gods glory, an eminent man in Gods Church, affirming theſe things of himſelfe with his owne mouth, that thus it was with him. And from his example wee may conclude, that thus it is with the beſt of Gods children. For why? as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer things are written aforetime, are written</hi> in the Booke of God, <hi>for our learning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee muſt make vſe to our ſelues of the inſtructions of the Word, laid downe either generally in the doctrine of it, or particularly in the examples of it: Therefore the Apoſtle thus ſetting himſelfe before vs, that thus it was with him, he being a man truly regenerate, and an holy man of God, wee may ſafely conclude, that thus it is with the reſt of Gods children. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16.</note> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For this cauſe was he, being chiefe of ſinners,</hi> as there he ſpeakes, <hi>receiued to mercy, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould ſhew on him all long ſuffering, vnto the example of them which ſhould, in time to come beleeue in him vnto eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, the examples of holy men of GOD are ſet downe in the Scripture for our vſe, for our good, &amp; for our comfort; and we may gather, that ſeeing it was ſo with the Apoſtle, that he did the euill he would not haue done, therefore it is ſo with the reſt of Gods children.</p>
               <p>And this may ſerue to ſtrengthen poore weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their comfort, <label type="milestone">

               <p>We haue here <hi>Paul</hi> affirming in plaine termes, that thus it was with himſelfe, and from his example they may gather comfort to themſelues, and thus conceiue, that ſurely it is no otherwiſe with them then with the reſt of

               <p>The poore ſoule may eaſily anſwere him, It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am nothing, compared to <hi>Paul:</hi> but yet <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet himſelfe before me for an example, that thus it was with him, that he did the euill he hated, and the good he would haue done, he did not, and hee being an excellent man, a man of rare gifts, and of great grace, my comfort is the greater; I may from his example conclude, that the beſt of Gods children haue their weakneſſes and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full infirmities, and therefore no maruell though it be ſo with mee, euen the Apoſtle, who had ſuch a meaſure of Faith,

               <p>Theſe and many other teſtimonies cleare and confirme this truth to vs, that the moſt holy, and moſt regenerate that liue on the face of the earth, haue in them both fleſh and Spirit, there is grace and corruption ſtill in part abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all the powers of their ſoules, and in all the parts and members of their bodies. Howſoeuer the Lord could free his children altogether from the corruption of nature, whileſt they liue here in this world, by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke of his holy Spirit, yet he is pleaſed to ſuffer ſome relikes of it ſtill to abide in them, for ſpeciall good cauſes.</p>
               <p>As for the beating downe of pride, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> leſt they ſhould be too much lifted vp in them themſelues.</p>
               <p>For the exerciſe of their faith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their hope, their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and other graces.</p>
               <p>For the ſtirring of them vp to feruent Prayer. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               </p>
               <p>For the manifeſtation of his own Power, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in vpholding them in their temptations.</p>
               <p>For theſe and the like good cauſes, is the Lord pleaſed to ſuffer ſome remnants of corruption ſtill to abide in his children, and ſo the beſt that liue on the face of the earth, haue in them both fleſh and Spirit, both grace and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And this, for the vſe of it,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> meetes with ſome erroneous opinions, as that of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Papiſts,
<note place="margin">Some Popiſh opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> touching the liberty of the Goſpell: They teach, That by the liberty of the Goſpell men are altogether freed from ſinne: ſo that, as they ſay, ſinne is throughly dead, and not only not imputed, but not aliue, not hauing any being in the righteous: ſo they hold. Now that is a foule and groſſe error, directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Truth now deliuered.</p>
               <p>Againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this Truth meetes with that fooliſh conceite
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:422:256"/> of the Familiſts and others,
<note place="margin">Familiſts alſo confuted.</note> who dreame of a perfection of inherent holineſſe, grace and ſanctification in the time of this life.</p>
               <p>The beſt and the moſt holy haue in them not only grace, but corruption ſtill abiding in part in all the powers of their ſoules, and in all the parts and members of their bodies, and that keepes them, that they cannot poſſibly aſpire to perfection of holineſſe in the time of this life.</p>
               <p>Againe, is it ſo, that the moſt holy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the moſt rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, whileſt they liue here in this world,
<note place="margin">The beſt of Gods children are ſtill to be purging out corruption, &amp; ſtill to be growing in grace.</note> haue in them not only Spirit, but fleſh alſo? haue they in them aſwell a meaſure of corruption, as a meaſure of grace? Surely, then it concernes the beſt of vs, whoſoeuer we be, that haue attained the greateſt meaſure of grace, ſtill to bee purging out corruption, and ſtill to be growing in grace, and ſtill to be gathering increaſe of grace: and though we haue as great a meaſure of grace and holineſſe, as the beſt of Gods Children euer had, yet ſtill we haue fleſh in vs, and ſtill we haue our weakneſſes.</p>
               <p>And be we ſure of this, where we are weake, be it in knowledge, or be it in affection; there at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall be aſſaulted and tried, and there the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will come againſt vs: and therefore we are euery day more and more to be purging out the old lumpe, and ſtil to be caſting off the old man piece after piece, and euery day to labour with our owne hearts to empty out the corruption of them; our worke in this kinde is neuer at an end, whileſt we liue here in this world: and to this purpoſe we are to be conſtant in the vſe of the meanes: In hearing the Word, In reading, In Prayer, In applying the power of Chriſt his death to our owne ſoules. And thinke not, becauſe thou haſt a great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and other good gifts, that therefore thou haſt no need to attend on the miniſterie of the Word. No, no: thou haſt ſtill fleſh and corruption in thee, and thou haſt
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:422:257"/> neede ſtill to vſe good meanes, that may ſerue to purge it out continually; that is thy dutie.</p>
               <p>Now further obſerue we, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>
                  </label> that the Apoſtle deuiding himſelfe into minde and fleſh, he makes knowne how it was with him in reſpect of theſe two parts; as that <hi>in his minde,</hi> in his regenerate part, <hi>he ſerued the Law of God:</hi> but <hi>in his fleſh,</hi> in his part vnregenerate, <hi>he ſerued the law of ſinne.</hi> The point hence is this,</p>
               <p>That the Spirit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>6</label> and the fleſh, Grace and corruption, they carrie Gods children diuers,
<note place="margin">Grace &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption carrie Gods children contrarie wayes.</note> yea, contrary wayes: One carries them to that which is holy and good, and the other to that which is euill and ſinfull: grace in Gods children, that carries them to thinke, will and affect, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, deſire and endeuour the doing of good and holy things: and the corruption that is in them, that carries them to the cleane contrarie, to thinke, will, affect, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, deſire, and endeuour the doing of euill and wicked things.</p>
               <p>Thus are Gods children diuerſly carried, Grace carries them one way, and corruption, that hales and pulls them another way; and to this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes plainely,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh: and theſe are contrary one to the other, ſo that yee cannot do the ſame things that yee would.</hi> The fleſh, that ſtirres vp euill thoughts, motions and luſts; The Spirit, that ſtirres vp good thoughts, motions, purpoſes and deſires,

               <p>We ſee then, that grace and corruption, they carrie Gods children diuers, yea, contrary wayes. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this,</p>
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:422:257"/>
               <p>They are contrary grounds and beginnings, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</note> yea, they are as it were Lords and maſters of contrarie diſpoſitions; one is diſpoſed to good, &amp; the other to euill: and therefore no maruell though they carrie contrarie wayes, euen to contrary thoughts, affections, purpoſes, deſires and endeuours.</p>
               <p>Now here haply ſome may demaund, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> whether Grace and corruption do concurre and meete together in one and the ſame action, and do carrie Gods children, diuers or contrarie wayes in one and the ſame worke, yea or no?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That in ſome ſort they do, namely, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> thus: In a good action grace carries forward to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as it ought to be done, and corruption alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddles and hinders it from perfection, yea, it defiles it, and makes the beſt thing that is done by a childe of God, vnable to ſtand in Gods ſight, if he ſhould not look on it in mercy.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, in an euill action, corruption carries forward to the doing of it, and therein alſo grace hath a working, not to the acting of it, but to curbe and reſtraine the fleſh, ſo that a child of God cannot do euill with full and habituall conſent of will. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9.</note> The ſeed of Grace remaines in him, and <hi>he cannot ſinne,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thus Grace and corruption do concurre in one and the ſame action, whether good or euill.
<note place="margin">The beſt good thing done by a child of God is ſtayned with ſinne.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This ſerues to diſcouer, that there is no good thing done by any Child of God, but it is ſtayned with ſinne, intermeddling corruption defiles it.</p>
               <p>Then (ſay the Papiſts) it pleaſeth not God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> if it bee ſinfull. An idle cauill.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if it were abſolutely ſinfull, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> then it could not pleaſe God: but it is holy and good, for the kinde as it is inioyned by God, and as it comes from the Spirit of God, though in the manner of doing it failes, and comes ſhort of perfection, and is ſinfull, that ſinfulnes the Lord
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:422:258"/> pardons, and ſo accepts of it, in and through Chriſt, as pleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>Againe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> is it ſo, that grace and corruption carry Gods children contrary wayes?
<note place="margin">We are not to think it ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, when we feele our ſelues car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried contrary-wayes.</note> grace carries them to good, and corruption to euill? Then we may not thinke it ſtrange when we feele our ſelues ſo carried, and when we would thinke of good things, &amp; delight in them, and do them, we are hindered, and we cannot thinke of them, delight in them, and do them as we deſire; it is the caſe of the deareſt of Gods children many times when they would thinke of good things, their mindes are carried from them, or they are dull &amp; heauy in thinking of them, and when they would beleeue the ſweet promiſes of the Word of God, they are oppreſſed with vnbeliefe, and the like: it is a mercy of God when thou feeleſt thy ſelfe carried contrary wayes, thou wouldeſt thinke of good things, delight in them, and do them, and thine owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption carries thee a contrary way, if thou feeleſt it with griefe; thouſands in the world are carried but one way, they goe on in an euill courſe, their mindes are carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euill, they affect it, and do it with pleaſure, it neuer troubles them; and therefore, I ſay, it is a mercy of God vouchſafed to thee, if thou feeleſt thy ſelfe carryed away from God with great griefe.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with Gods Children, yea, doubtleſſe Gods Children thinke their preſent corruption euer the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt: Becauſe the more grace they haue, the more they feele their corruption. And as one ſaith well; They that holde themſelues to bee the Children of God, and yet feele not themſelues carryed contrarie wayes, in reſpect of grace and corruption, they haue either <hi>Angelicall</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (which let them take to themſelues that can) or they haue not as yet the Spirit of Chriſt. And therefore let not this trouble thee, becauſe thou feeleſt thy ſelfe carryed contrary wayes, when thou wouldſt thinke of good things, delight in them, and doe them, thou art
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:422:258"/> hindered and thou canſt not thinke of them, delight in them, and doe them as thou deſireſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this being ſo, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> that grace and corruption car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Gods Children contrary wayes:
<note place="margin">Grace muſt be kept in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall exerciſe.</note> This muſt teach them to keepe grace in continuall exerciſe.

               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In my minde I ſerue the Law of God, and in my fleſh the law of ſinne:</hi> The Papiſts haue this note, (ſay they) Nothing done by concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, whereunto the Spirit, reaſon or mind of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents not, can make him guiltie before God.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is not held guiltie of that euill, becauſe the Lord is pleaſed to looke on him, in and through Chriſt, and by his grace in him to acquit and diſcharge him of the guiltineſſe of that ſinne, but in it ſelfe it makes him guiltie and liable to the curſe of God, and to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting perdition.</p>
